(WIP) A utility for collecting and organizing research papers to perform automated science.

### Future Features:
- Add detail chunks with citations to the paper graphs
- Add hierarchical organization to papers
-  Switch to an responsive frontend for more custom visualization
- Generating hypotheses/areas of interest from a group of papers/texts (automated generation of hypotheses -> paper searching and analyses -> new areas of interest -> repeat)
