## Scrapp
![alt text](https://github.com/plehman2000/scrapp/blob/main/assets/graph.png?raw=true)

(WIP) A utility for collecting and organizing information in scientific papers. This will likely remain untouched until I understand ontology generation better.



### Future Features:
- Scrapp Groups - collections of information centered around one main topic
- Collecting research papers to perform automated science.
- Add detail chunks with citations to the paper graphs
- Add hierarchical organization to papers
-  Switch to an responsive frontend for more custom visualization
- Generating hypotheses/areas of interest from a group of papers/texts (automated generation of hypotheses -> paper searching and analyses -> new areas of interest -> repeat)
