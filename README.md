(WIP) A utility for collecting and organizing information in scientific papers. 


### Future Features:
- More complex ontologies
- Scrapp Groups - collections of information centered around one main topic, decentrally stored/ updated
- Collecting research papers to perform automated science.
- Add hierarchical organization to papers
-  Switch to an responsive frontend for more custom visualization
- Generating hypotheses/areas of interest from a group of papers/texts (automated generation of hypotheses -> paper searching and analyses -> new areas of interest -> repeat)
