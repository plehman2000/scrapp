        <p><strong>“A .40 caliber? Pffft That caliber is dying. Get with
 the times Dan and get a double stack 9mm 2011 with a red dot optic…” 
(For the record, my daily carry gun is a 9mm Sig Sauer but my SHTF gun 
is a full size .40 - I’m going to tell you why below. Oh and neither has
 a red dot but that is a topic for another article…)</strong></p><p>A few months back I wrote a blog post titled: “<a href="https://blog.ammosquared.com/post/whats-in-your-wallet/">What’s in Your Wallet</a>”
 about my personal ammo wallet and the calibers I’m accumulating at 
AmmoSquared. One of those calibers is 40 S&amp;W Practice. This is not a
 very popular round these days as you might have noticed. It isn’t 
extinct of course, but its popularity has drastically declined over the 
past 5-10 years.</p><p>First of all, to kick off this article and get 
some hard numbers, one tool I like to use to check out how popular 
certain calibers are is Gunbroker. (I did this a lot when we were trying
 to find new and obscure calibers to add to our ammo catalogue, which 
was not a good business decision, as we now know!) Anyway, if you visit <a href="https://www.gunbroker.com/?ref=blog.ammosquared.com">Gunbroker.com</a>
 and browse to a particular type of firearm, in this case I’m interested
 in semi-auto pistols, the menu looks something like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="test_files/gunbroker-menu.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="841" height="333" srcset="test_files/gunbroker-menu_002.JPG 600w, test_files/gunbroker-menu.JPG 841w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What I do next is scroll down to the filters on the left side until I can see calibers. Like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="test_files/calibers.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="148" height="180"></figure><p>On
 this particular day, March 3rd 2023, there were 59,078 pistols 
available in 9mm, then another 11,897 in 22LR, and on down the list 
until we see that 40 S&amp;W squeaked into the top five with 4,590 
pistols. So 40 S&amp;W pistol volume available on Gunbroker is only 7.7%
 of the 9mm pistol volume… remember that percentage, 7.7%.</p><p>Here is something else I found really interesting…</p><p>The
 last time I ran a report on our caliber volume was a couple months ago 
in order to determine what SKUs to discontinue. At that time we were 
doing 31.4% our total volume in 9mm Practice and only 2.45% of our 
volume was in 40 S&amp;W Practice. So said another way our 40 S&amp;W 
Practice volume was 7.8% of our 9mm Practice volume! Weird.</p><p>How uncanny is that?</p><p>The
 two should be a good representation of the popularity of 9mm over 40 
S&amp;W. So knowing all this, why do I still own a 40 caliber pistol and
 even go so far as to say everyone should have one?</p><p>I’ll lay out 
my logic and maybe you’ll agree with it and maybe you won’t. That’s the 
amazing thing about opinions… they're like… uhm.. noses… everyone’s got 
one and they’re all different.</p><h3 id="ding-ding-time-for-a-caliber-debate"><strong>Ding-Ding time for a Caliber Debate!</strong></h3><p><strong>Bullet Construction</strong></p><p>Let’s
 start with the most divisive right up front. The argument is that 9mm 
is just as good as 40 caliber now with modern bullets. That is why the 
FBI switched over to it and why many (most?) law enforcement agencies 
are switching too.</p><p>My response to that is simple - if the bullets 
in 9mm are better then so are the 40 caliber bullets. An HST or a Gold 
Dot isn’t suddenly less effective in a 40 then in a 9mm, right? There is
 no question that if you push a bigger bullet faster, it will be more 
effective. The only question when it comes to handguns is, does it 
matter in the real world? Lot’s of people say “no”. I say, why not take 
the bigger bullet? This is a game of compromise and some people want to 
compromise here while others would rather compromise on capacity which 
I’ll cover next. For now, head to head, a 40 is bigger and heavier so it
 wins this round.</p><p><em>Advantage: 40 S&amp;W</em></p><p><strong>Magazine Capacity</strong></p><p>In
 just about every gun that is made as a 9mm and a 40 S&amp;W, the 9mm 
will hold 2 more rounds. A typical full size 9mm like a Glock 17 has a 
17 round capacity while the Glock 22 has a 15 round capacity.</p><p>My 
opinion here is that 2 extra rounds only matters for small capacity 
guns. If you have a concealed carry gun (like I do) that only holds 12 
rounds of 9mm, then switching to a 40 in the same gun is bigger 
percentage difference then the Glock 17 / 22 example above. So said 
another way, 40 is great for full size guns with higher capacities 
already - not so great if you are already trying to squeeze as many 
rounds as possible in a small frame guns. In that case pick the 9mm.</p><p><em>Advantage: 9mm</em></p><p><strong>Recoil Control and Follow-up Shots</strong></p><p>There
 is no debate that a 40 recoils harder than a 9mm. The argument goes 
that since a 9mm recoil is lighter, a shooter can get back on target and
 get the next shot(s) off quicker.</p><p>I haven’t done the testing 
personally and I’m sure there is someone out there that has, but we’re 
talking tenths of seconds at best. With practice I can hammer a pair of 
40’s out faster than some shooters can do with 9mm. So honestly this one
 comes down to proficiency, and since we are talking about recoil I 
would also say gun size. A tiny concealed carry gun is going to be much 
harder to control in a 40 then in a 9mm. A full size gun in 40 on the 
other hand, I have to believe the split time is negligible if the 
shooter is proficient with the 40. Exhibit A: <a href="https://youtu.be/W7W-5QE3jzw?t=86&amp;ref=blog.ammosquared.com">Jerry Miculek with six shots of 44 magnum in 1 second</a>…</p><p><em>Advantage: 9mm for small guns and/or less proficient shooters</em></p><p><strong>Cost</strong></p><p>There
 is no question on this one, 9mm is cheaper. Since it is produced in 
such great quantities compared to just about every other round out 
there, it is going to be the cheapest in normal times. Currently our <a href="https://ammosquared.com/product_price_details/HG-40SW-PRTC?ref=blog.ammosquared.com">40 S&amp;W Practice</a> is $0.46/rnd, but our <a href="https://ammosquared.com/product_price_details/HG-9MM-PRTC?ref=blog.ammosquared.com">9mm Practice</a>
 is averaging $0.34/rnd, so 26% cheaper. The theory goes, that since 9mm
 is cheaper, folks can afford to practice with it more. That is true. 
Also government agencies and pencil pushers like the fact that is 
cheaper. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that is weighted pretty 
heavily when a department or government agency decides to adopt 9mm over
 40 S&amp;W. Why go with a more expensive round, if this one will do the
 job just fine?</p><p><em>Advantage: 9mm</em></p><p><strong>Availability</strong></p><p>This
 is where things get a little squirrely. Now that we’ve all lived 
through yet another ammo crunch, we’ve seen some things haven’t we? In 
my mind, 9mm is the victim of its own success. During normal times - 
like now, 9mm is pretty widely available. You can find it for sale 
online or at your local gun store. BUT as we all saw recently when 
supply is limited and demand skyrockets, everyone and their third cousin
 twice removed wants 9mm. If 12 people want 9mm and 1 wants 40, then the
 9mm is going to disappear first (unless the gun store carries 12x more 
9mm… but that usually isn’t the case).</p><p>During the ammo shortage, 
9mm disappeared first then was not available at all from our 
distributors… but I could find plenty of 40 S&amp;W for a long time and 
believe it or not even 357 Sig. If you are stockpiling then this is less
 of a concern of course.</p><p><em>Advantage: Mixed (Normal Times vs Shortage)</em></p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>This
 finally brings me around to my opening statement: Everyone should own a
 full size 40 cal pistol… but I will add the following: WITH a drop in 
9mm conversion barrel (and if you are really a gun geek like me, a drop 
in 357 Sig barrel as well).</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because this combo covers 
all of the advantages of the 9mm and the 40 and has no drawbacks (unless
 the pistol you want doesn’t have that option). I know at least the big 
three: Glock, Sig and S&amp;W all have full size pistols with drop in 
9mm options.</p><p>This is why my main “go to war” full size pistol is a
 5” S&amp;W M&amp;P 2.0 originally chambered in 40 S&amp;W with a drop 
in 9mm conversion barrel from <a href="https://www.apextactical.com/apex-grade-9mm-semi-drop-in-barrels?ref=blog.ammosquared.com">Apex</a> and a somewhat hard to find .357 Sig barrel from KKM.</p><p>This
 way I have the slight edge in power and penetration from the 40 S&amp;W
 or 357 Sig when I want it, but the lower recoil and cheap practice 
rounds available in 9mm when I want that. If there is an ammo shortage 
and I can’t find 9mm for some reason, I can always buy 40 S&amp;W or 
even 357 Sig. Also, since I’m polyarmorous (I love many different 
calibers) I can take one “main” pistol to the range and mix it up when I
 get bored with a 30 second barrel and mag change.</p><p>Since 40 and 
357 Sig share the same case diameter it makes them an easy barrel swap 
away, but 9mm is smaller so you will need a barrel and 9mm specific 
magazines. Also because of that, you can’t go from a 9mm pistol and drop
 in a 40 barrel, it won’t work, it has to be the other way around: a 
40cal pistol and a 9mm barrel.</p><p>Since many police agencies are 
moving away from 40 caliber you can pick up a cheap police trade in 
pistol and get a new 9mm barrel for it, so you have the best of both 
worlds. Don’t let the cult of 9mm fool you into thinking 9mm is the only
 handgun round on the planet and everything else is blasphemous. 
Calibers aren’t marriages! Explore and play around with other calibers… 
don’t be afraid to be polyarmorous like me!</p><hr><p>AmmoSquared Inc.
