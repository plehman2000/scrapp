<p><strong>John Hanno  – Tarbabys  –  March 16, 2024</strong></p>



<p>“Honest Don” just threw down the debate gauntlet for President Biden to chuckle at. During trump’s 6-year long reign of deceit, disinformation and disdain for the truth, media organizations from far and wide, created whole departments just to keep track of trump’s lies. After tallying more than 40,000, most gave up.  The Washington Post made a valiant attempt 3 years ago, (“Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims as president. Nearly half came in his final year.”) (article attached below). Why would President Biden even consider debating someone who isn’t remotely capable of rational discussions of policy or governance? trump refused to debate any of his republican primary opponents, especially Nicki Haley, who would have beaten him like a rented mule. </p>



<p>It’s crystal clear to anyone who has successfully passed the age of reason; trump’s dishonesty and lies, his criminal activity of all sorts, nor his conspiracies to destroy our Democracy and Democratic institutions, has had a miniscule effect on trump’s MAGA core of sheeple. Critical thinking folks know full well, who trump is, the carnage he’s capable of invoking and where his patriotic loyalties lie. He will conspire with any person, group or country, hostile or otherwise, foreign or domestic, in order to get back into the White House, in order to dismiss or pardon any conviction in the 91 felony counts, in his criminal cases pending in 4 different jurisdictions. Just as he’s done to anyone stupid enough to throw in with this sociopathic, moronic human being, trump is fully capable of throwing his country and our Democracy under the bus, in order to inflate his ego and his cratering business reputation and wealth. Anyone foolish enough to get entangled in the trump mystique, has regretted their gamble at fame and fortune. </p>



<p>“Honest Don” “honestly” believes, that the majority of American’s he’s slandered and persecuted since sailing down that escalator in 2016, including women, people of color and naturalized immigrants, will somehow embrace his march to a trumpian Kleptocratic Autocracy. Why shouldn’t he, the MAGA republicans in congress, and more than half of our Supreme Court have acquiesced, hook-line-and sinker. </p>



<p>But how can you agree to a political debate with someone who doesn’t believe in the notions of political compromise, Democratic governance or even presenting a platform designed to help solve America’s and the world’s myriad of complicated and urgent problems. Any debate will only reinforce MAGAnians maniacal devotion, no matter the outcome. President Biden should present his case directly to voters who are still able to ascertain the truth. </p>

<p>CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA – OCTOBER 07: Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump arrives for a rally on October 07, 2023 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the third straight presidential election, Donald Trump is campaigning on an avalanche of&nbsp;dishonesty.</p>



<p>CNN fact-checked 12 of the former president’s October and November speeches. We found, as we did&nbsp;<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/11/07/media/donald-trump-fact-checking/index.html">during his 2016 campaign</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/19/politics/fact-check-daniel-dale-reflections-fact-checking-trump/index.html">his presidency</a>, that Trump’s fall remarks were&nbsp;teeming with false claims – a staggering quantity and variety of misrepresentations, exaggerations and outright lies that made sheer wrongness a central feature of each of his addresses.</p>



<p>As in the past, Trump is in a league of his own. The frequency of his mendacity vastly exceeds that of either President Joe Biden or any of Trump’s rivals in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.</p>



<p>In the October and November speeches, Trump was serially untruthful on the subject of his record in office. He continued to tell long-debunked lies about the 2020 election he lost and the integrity of elections more broadly. He repeatedly fabricated and embellished on the subjects of energy, the environment, foreign affairs and the economy.</p>



<p>He launched incorrect attacks against Biden, other Democrats and Republican presidential rivals Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. He deployed various fictions to support his denunciations of the criminal and civil court cases against him. And he continued his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/28/politics/trump-exaggerates-unemployment-accomplishments/index.html">traditional practice</a>&nbsp;of wildly exaggerating statistics, this time on topics ranging from the price of bacon to the cost of an aircraft carrier to the size of his rally crowds.</p>



<p>Below is a fact check of 102 of Trump’s false claims from the 12 speeches. He repeated many of the false claims on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>This is not intended as a comprehensive list. And it does not include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/politics/trump-verbal-slip-ups/index.html">gaffes</a>&nbsp;that were clearly unintentional, claims that were misleading but not outright wrong, or claims for which there was no public evidence but which we could not definitively declare incorrect.</p>



<h5 id="trumps-record">Trump’s record</h5>



<p><strong>Terrorist attacks under Trump</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531311-1/president-trump-campaigns-miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEoCpG4tpac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speeches</a>&nbsp;that there were no terrorist attacks during his time as president. “We didn’t have an attack for four years,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire while touting his ban on travel from a group of (mostly Muslim-majority) countries he described as “horrendous, dangerous nations.” “We didn’t have one incident in four years, because we kept bad people the hell out of our country,” he said in an October speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that “we didn’t have an attack for four years”&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/politics/fact-check-trump-speech-new-hampshire/index.html"><em>isn’t true</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Trump’s own Justice Department&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/sayfullo-saipov-charged-terrorism-and-murder-aid-racketeering-connection-lower-manhattan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged</a>&nbsp;that a mass murder in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was a terrorist attack carried out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/us/sayfullo-saipov-new-york-attack/index.html">in support of ISIS</a>; Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. Trump’s Justice Department also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-findings-criminal-investigation-december-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged</a>&nbsp;that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/politics/pensacola-shooting-al-qaeda/index.html">carried out</a>&nbsp;by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.</p>



<p>In addition, there were a variety of other terrorist attacks during Trump’s presidency. Notably, Trump’s Justice Department&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cesar-sayoc-pleads-guilty-65-felonies-mailing-16-improvised-explosive-devices-connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;it was a “domestic terrorist attack” when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/us/cesar-sayoc-letter-trump-rallies/index.html">one of Trump’s supporters</a>&nbsp;mailed improvised explosive devices to CNN, prominent Democratic officials and other people in 2018.</p>



<p>In 2019, a White supremacist pleaded guilty to multiple charges in New York,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/us/white-supremacist-sword-new-york-guilty/index.html">including</a>&nbsp;first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, for killing a Black man in March 2017 to try to start a race war. And Trump’s Justice Department&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/05/us/el-paso-suspect-patrick-crusius/index.html">described</a>&nbsp;a 2019 shooting massacre at a Walmart in Texas as an act of domestic terrorism; the gunman who killed 23 people was targeting Latinos.</p>



<p><strong>Trump’s wall promise</strong></p>



<p>In an October speech in Iowa, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/klMYiCN3A94?feature=shared&amp;t=1650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;he had run in 2016 on a promise that Mexico would pay for “a piece” of a new border wall. He&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231105_093600_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_at_Florida_Freedom_Summit/start/780/end/840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeated</a>&nbsp;the claim in a November speech in Florida, saying, “I said Mexico’s gonna pay for a piece of the wall.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims about what he said in the past are false. During his 2016 campaign, Trump promised over and over again in his public remarks, with no qualifications, that Mexico would pay for the entire wall, not for only “a piece” of it. (In the end, Mexico didn’t pay for any of it.) You can read a longer fact check on this claim&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/politics/fact-check-trump-mexico-piece-border-wall/index.html"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Mexico and the cost of the wall</strong></p>



<p>In an October&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech in New Hampshire</a>, Trump tried to respond to critics who have noted that he did not get Mexico to pay for the wall as he had promised. Pointing out that Mexico did&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/americas/mexico-sends-15000-troops-to-us-mexico-border-intl/index.html">deploy thousands of its own troops</a>&nbsp;during his presidency to deter migrants heading toward the US, Trump said, “Then they say, ‘Oh, Mexico didn’t pay.’ Mexico paid a fortune for that wall. When they tell you, ‘Trump didn’t get the money.’ Remember, I used to say Mexico will pay for it. Well, that’s what I did.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims that he “did” get Mexico to pay for the wall and that “Mexico paid a fortune for that wall” are false. Mexico deploying troops simply isn’t the same as Mexico paying for a construction project; even with the Mexican deployment, the US had to pay for the wall with its own money. The Trump administration&nbsp;</em><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>directed more than $16 billion toward the project</em></a><em>&nbsp;– including about $6 billion directly appropriated by Congress and about $10 billion the administration repurposed from the Defense Department – before Biden&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/politics/border-wall-joe-biden-defense-department/index.html"><em>halted construction</em></a><em>&nbsp;upon taking office in 2021.</em></p>



<p>The final bill for the project is unclear; more than $4.7 billion of the former Defense Department money&nbsp;<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had not been spent</a>&nbsp;at the time Trump left office. Regardless, it is clear that Mexico spent nothing at all on the project.</p>



<p>“The US government paid for what was built of Trump’s wall out of our own treasury. Mexico did not directly pay for any portion of the wall,”&nbsp;<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/theresa-cardinal-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theresa Cardinal Brown</a>, an immigration and border policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, said in a July email.</p>



<p><strong>The size of the wall</strong></p>



<p>Touting his wall on the border with Mexico, Trump claimed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;that he had built “561 miles of wall” or, more vaguely,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the</a>&nbsp;total was “over 500 miles.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s “561 miles” and “over 500 miles” claims are false, both exaggerations. An&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/19/politics/fact-check-christie-trump-border-wall/index.html"><em>official report by US Customs and Border Protection</em></a><em>, written two days after Trump left office and subsequently obtained by CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said the total number built under Trump was 458 miles (including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers). Even in his recent speeches, Trump sometimes put the figure, more correctly, at “nearly 500 miles.”</em></p>



<p>For example, in one October speech in Iowa, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/PgxN4h7eCJfBHlDE4CYxTJbvMD46meXE2QuR_F_48NxdYpXew1nZOU-q11D3rMicd4AXYThT1hjk9fsb27-Du6r9z9s?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=1122.51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “We built 561 – they said 460, 460. But no, it’s 561.” Later in the speech, though, when he appeared to be reading from his prepared text, he said, “Built nearly 500 miles.”</p>



<p><strong>Trump and the military</strong></p>



<p>In speech after speech, Trump repeated a claim he had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/10/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-spending-us-military-rebuild/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made during his presidency</a>&nbsp;– saying “<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I fully rebuilt the US military</a>,” “<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/3120/end/3180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve rebuilt the entire military</a>,” or “<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531077-1/president-donald-trump-campaigns-adel-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we rebuilt our whole military</a>.” He periodically made clear that he was talking about military equipment,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>&nbsp;that, before he came along and did this rebuilding, the country had “48-year-old fighter jets.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim to have rebuilt the entire military is false. “This claim is not even close to being true. The military has tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, and the vast majority of it predates the Trump administration,” said&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.aei.org/profile/todd-harrison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Todd Harrison</em></a><em>, an expert on the defense budget and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.</em></p>



<p>Harrison said in a November email: “Moreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It’s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military’s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F-15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.”</p>



<p><strong>Trump’s policy on damage to monuments</strong></p>



<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October speech in New Hampshire</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531311-1/president-trump-campaigns-miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Florida</a>, Trump claimed that, as president, he had found and “signed” an “old law” or “old statute” to impose a severe penalty – an automatic 10 years in jail – for people who damage monuments.</p>



<p>“It said if you so much as touch one of our statues or memorials, you go to jail for 10 years with no probation, no anything – you go for 10 years. And you all remember that,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231113_070400_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in the Florida speech.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims are false. He didn’t sign any “law” on damage to monuments, and he did not impose automatic 10-year sentences for monument damage. In fact, he issued an&nbsp;</em><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-american-monuments-memorials-statues-combating-recent-criminal-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>executive order</em></a><em>&nbsp;on the subject</em>,&nbsp;<em>in 2020, that did not mandate any increase in sentences.</em></p>



<p>Rather, the executive order simply directed the attorney general to “prioritize” investigations and prosecutions of monument-destruction cases and declared that it is federal policy to prosecute such cases to the fullest extent permitted under existing law – including an existing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1666-destruction-government-property-18-usc-1361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">law</a>&nbsp;that allowed a sentence of&nbsp;<em>up to</em>&nbsp;10 years in prison for willfully damaging federal property if the damage exceeds $100. The executive order did nothing to force judges to impose a 10-year sentence.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve</strong></p>



<p>As he has on multiple previous occasions, Trump claimed in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?530983-1/donald-trump-campaigns-wolfeboro-nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October speech in New Hampshire</a>&nbsp;that “we filled up the national reserve, strategic reserves.” He went into more detail in a November&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;in Houston,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/-f246Mq8W-4?feature=shared&amp;t=3444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>&nbsp;of the reserve, “We filled that thing and nobody ever saw anything like it.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims that he filled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are false.</em><br><em>While he did&nbsp;</em><strong><em>propose</em></strong><em>&nbsp;to buy&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-executes-direction-president-trump-announces-solicitation-purchase-crude" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>77 million barrels</em></a><em>&nbsp;for the reserve in 2020 as oil prices&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/business/oil-price-crash-bankruptcy/index.html"><em>cratered</em></a><em>&nbsp;because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Democratic-controlled Congress&nbsp;</em><a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/03/25/oil-purchase-to-fill-strategic-reserve-dropped-from-stimulus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>rejected</em></a><em>&nbsp;the $3 billion in funding that would have paid for the purchase, describing it as a subsidy to big oil companies, so it didn’t happen. The reserve&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=WCSSTUS1&amp;f=W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>contained fewer barrels</em></a><em>&nbsp;when Trump left office in early 2021 (about 638 million) than when he took office in early 2017 (about 695 million).</em></p>



<p>That’s in large part because of oil sales that Congress had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/history-spr-releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandated</a>&nbsp;by law. But nonetheless, Trump’s claims about how he “filled up” the reserve are meritless.</p>



<p>“It would have been a smart policy to refill the SPR at very low prices, but it didn’t happen because Congress did not approve that purchase. I suppose Trump can take credit for a good idea, but not for execution,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csis.org/people/ben-cahill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Cahill</a>, a senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/05/politics/fact-check-trump-petroleum-reserve-oil/index.html">told CNN earlier this year</a>&nbsp;when Trump made a similar claim.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and manufacturing jobs, part 1</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Texas: “We created an incredible 1.2 million new manufacturing jobs. Nobody said that was possible.” He repeated the number a bit later and said, “Everybody said that was impossible.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s number is false. The US actually&nbsp;</em><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>lost 170,000 manufacturing jobs</em></a><em>&nbsp;during Trump’s presidency, largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even if you were to stop the count in February 2020, before the pandemic crash, the US would have gained 419,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of Trump’s presidency in January 2017, not the 1.2 million he claimed here</em>.</p>



<p>In speeches in late 2019 and early 2020, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://factba.se/trump/search#1.2%2Bmillion%2Bmanufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;that the US had created 1.2 million manufacturing&nbsp;<em>and construction&nbsp;</em>jobs during his tenure. That would&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USCONS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still be true today</a>&nbsp;if you stopped the clock in February 2020. But Trump didn’t mention construction jobs in this speech; his omission made his performance with manufacturing jobs sound much better than it was.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and manufacturing jobs, part 2</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vowed</a>&nbsp;in the same speech in Texas to “accelerate our manufacturing resurgence,” then said, “We were setting records – not only were we building and doing it, we were setting records at doing manufacturing jobs.”</p>



<p><strong>﻿Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. Trump did not come close to setting records for the creation of manufacturing jobs. Again, US manufacturing employment actually&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.americanmanufacturing.org/blog/what-did-donald-trump-accomplish-for-american-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>declined</em></a><em>&nbsp;by 170,000 jobs during his presidency. While that’s largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the US was not even setting records before that; the country&nbsp;</em><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>lost manufacturing jobs in 2019</em></a><em>, before the pandemic hit.</em></p>



<p>And while the US did see a 430,000-job gain in manufacturing employment under Trump in 2017 and 2018, that was nowhere near a record increase. For example, there were more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs added in 1977 and 1978, Jimmy Carter’s first two calendar years as president.</p>



<p><strong>Household income under Trump</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?530983-1/donald-trump-campaigns-wolfeboro-nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire: “Under President Trump, real family income increased over $6,000 a year.”&nbsp; He had made a similar claim in a speech in Iowa that month,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>&nbsp;real family income “went up by more than $6,000 a year.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Real median household income</em></a><em>&nbsp;actually increased by $5,820&nbsp;<strong>in total&nbsp;</strong>over Trump’s four years in office, from $70,840 in 2016 to $76,660 in 2020 – so not $6,000 “a year” as he claimed here.</em></p>



<p>Trump’s campaign has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/14/politics/fact-check-trump-claims-about-biden-economy/index.html">confirmed</a>&nbsp;he was referring to real median household income when making such claims. The increase in real median household is over $6,000 if you just look at the period from 2016 to 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, but Trump’s presidency includes 2020 as well.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and the defeat of ISIS</strong></p>



<p>As he has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/05/politics/fact-check-trump-cpac/index.html">in the past</a>, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire: “I defeated ISIS. I defeated ISIS. Three weeks, I defeated ISIS.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim of having defeated ISIS in “three weeks” isn’t true; the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/23/middleeast/isis-caliphate-end-intl"><em>in 2019</em></a><em>. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/26/politics/donald-trump-iraq-visit/index.html"><em>in late December 2018</em></a><em>, as he has sometimes suggested, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trump-takes-too-much-credit-on-isis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>he has before</em></a><em>, when he said “I defeated ISIS” with no caveats or credit to anyone else: Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016.</em></p>



<p>IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.ihsmarkit.com/prviewer/release_only/slug/aerospace-defense-security-islamic-state-lost-almost-quarter-its-territory-2016-ihs-ma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>&nbsp;at the time.</p>



<p><strong>The cost of an embassy move</strong></p>



<p>In October speeches&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEoCpG4tpac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the Republican Jewish Coalition</a>&nbsp;and at a campaign&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">event in Florida</a>, Trump repeated a story&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/politics/fact-check-trump-dishonest-weekend-florida-michigan-georgia-wisconsin/index.html">he used to tell during his presidency</a>&nbsp;about how moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was supposed to cost $1 billion or $2 billion but that he “got it done for $500,000” by using an existing US diplomatic facility in Jerusalem.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim is false. While the final cost of the embassy move isn’t publicly known, it is clear that the cost was much more than $500,000. The State Department&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/politics/us-embassy-jerusalem-cost/index.html"><em>awarded a $21.2 million contract in 2018</em></a>&nbsp;<em>for a company to design and build “compound security upgrades” related to Trump’s decision to turn the existing Jerusalem facility into an embassy. The initial modification that allowed the building to open as an embassy cost just under $400,000, but that was not the final total.</em><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Trump and the construction of Nord Stream 2</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231010_023200_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/1140/end/1200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire that, after he “stopped” Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany, “it was totally dead” before Biden allowed it to proceed.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump did not render Nord Stream 2 “totally dead.” While he did&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-eu-decry-us-nord-stream-sanctions/a-51759319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>approve sanctions</em></a><em>&nbsp;on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/18/us-sanctions-on-nord-stream-2-pipeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>around an estimated 90% complete</em></a><em>&nbsp;– and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-s-gazprom-says-will-complete-nord-stream-2-alone/30403428.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>said</em></a><em>&nbsp;shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.ogj.com/pipelines-transportation/pipelines/article/14189195/nord-stream-2-pipelay-resumes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>announced</em></a><em>&nbsp;in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/germany-nord-stream-2-construction-russia/31048298.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>announced</em></a><em>&nbsp;that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters.</em></p>



<p>The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/business/nord-stream-pipeline-germany-russia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halting the project</a>&nbsp;as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/energy/nord-stream-pipeline-leaks-sabotage-intl-hnk/index.html">described as a likely act of sabotage</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and awareness of Nord Stream 2</strong></p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Houston</a>, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/-f246Mq8W-4?feature=shared&amp;t=1409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline: “Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along. Nobody knew they were building the biggest pipeline anyone’s ever seen, I guess – covering all of Europe.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Both parts of this claim are wrong.</em></p>



<p>It’s not true that “nobody” had heard of Nord Stream 2 before Trump began discussing it. Nord Stream 2 was a regular subject of media, government and diplomatic discussion before Trump took office. In fact, Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-europe-usa/biden-nord-stream-2-pipeline-is-a-bad-deal-for-europe-idUSKCN1101AP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly criticized it as vice president in 2016</a>. And Nord Stream 2 was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.offshore-technology.com/features/worlds-longest-pipelines/?cf-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nowhere close</a>&nbsp;to “the biggest pipeline anyone’s ever seen.”</p>



<p><strong>Trump and deportations to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador</strong></p>



<p>In a November speech in Florida, Trump talked about how his administration was able to deport gang members to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – and&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231105_093600_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_at_Florida_Freedom_Summit/start/1320/end/1380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeated</a>&nbsp;his familiar false claim about how the Obama administration was supposedly unable to do so: “Under the Obama administration, they wouldn’t take anybody back. They put airplanes, big commercial planes on the runways, so we’d put them in a plane, we’d fly, we couldn’t land, came back. And this went on for years; never took ‘em back.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First:</strong>&nbsp;<em>This claim remains false. In 2016, Obama’s last calendar year in office, none of these three countries was on the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Homan%20Responses%20to%20QFRs1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>list</em></a><em>&nbsp;of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant” (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.</em></p>



<p>The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, noted to CNN in 2019 that in the 2016 fiscal year, ICE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2016/removal-stats-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=809854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 fiscal year,</a>&nbsp;which encompassed the end of Obama’s presidency and the beginning of Trump’s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.</p>



<p>ICE officials said there were some exceptions to the three countries’ general cooperativeness, but Trump’s general declaration that the countries were uncooperative was never true.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and the word ‘caravan’</strong></p>



<p>In November speeches in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531311-1/president-trump-campaigns-miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a>, Trump spoke of migrant caravans – and claimed,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1619401925815828481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as he has in the past</a>, that he was the one to come up with the name “caravan.”</p>



<p>In Florida, he&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231113_070400_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/2100/end/2160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;caravan is “a name I came up with.” In Texas, he&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/-f246Mq8W-4?feature=shared&amp;t=4415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “I came up with the name. I believe. They’ll say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t really you, it’s somebody,’ but I believe I came up with the name.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump did not come up with the word “caravan,” either in general or to describe groups of migrants traveling together toward the US border during his presidency.</em></p>



<p>Merriam-Webster&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/the-history-of-caravan-words-for-people-in-movement-invasion-migration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a>&nbsp;the word caravan “came to English in the late 16th century, from the Italian&nbsp;<em>caravana</em>, which itself came from the Persian&nbsp;<em>kārvān</em>.”</p>



<p>Trump first publicly used a variation of the word as president in a tweet&nbsp;<a href="https://factba.se/trump/search#caravan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on April 1, 2018</a>&nbsp;(he wrote, in a tweet about immigration, “’caravans’ coming”). The word had been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/a-huge-caravan-of-central-americans-is-headed-for-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://nacla.org/blog/2018/01/29/migrant-trail-refugee-movement-emerges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://cis.org/Luna/Caravan-Central-American-Illegal-Aliens-Heads-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various others</a>&nbsp;in the same context in the days and weeks prior, including in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/a-huge-caravan-of-central-americans-is-headed-for-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BuzzFeed News feature article, two days prior</a>&nbsp;to Trump’s tweet, that was headlined, “A Huge Caravan Of Central Americans Is Headed For The US, And No One In Mexico Dares To Stop Them.”</p>



<p><strong>Trump’s claims about Covid-19</strong></p>



<p>Talking about the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire: “Once Covid came in from China – Wuhan. Remember I said it came in from Wuhan. Everyone said, ‘Why would he say that? It came in from caves.’ First they said it came in from Italy, which was not nice. Then they said it came in from France. Then they said the American soldiers brought it in, and then they admitted it came in from China – but it came in from Wuhan.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s recounting is inaccurate. It’s not true that, when he said Covid-19 came from Wuhan, “everyone said, ‘Why would he say that?’” In reality, when Trump&nbsp;</em><a href="https://factba.se/trump/search#wuhan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>first used the word “Wuhan” as president in March 2020</em></a><em>, saying the virus came from there was not at all controversial; Trump’s comments came more than two months after Chinese authorities publicly&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>identified Wuhan as the first place it had an outbreak of the novel coronavirus</em></a><em>. And in January and February 2020, before Trump started speaking about Wuhan, major media outlets such as&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/26/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-update-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a><em>&nbsp; and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/health/coronavirus-symptoms-germany.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>&nbsp;referred to the virus as “the Wuhan coronavirus.”</em></p>



<p><strong>The situation before Right to Try</strong></p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Texas</a>, Trump touted the “Right to Try” law he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/politics/right-to-try-donald-trump/index.html">signed in 2018</a>&nbsp;to give terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven’t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. As he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/politics/fact-check-trump-87-false-claims-mid-september/index.html">did during his presidency</a>, though, Trump also painted an inaccurate picture of the situation prior to the Right to Try era.</p>



<p>He said, “People would be terminally ill. They’d try to get a medicine; they couldn’t get it in this country. It’s totally illegal. If they had money, they’d go to Europe or they’d go to China, go to some of the places where they supposedly had cures. It never worked, by the way, almost never. And they’d end up dying. Sometimes they’d die in foreign lands. If you didn’t have money, you’d go home and you’d die.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications – but the government almost always said yes.</em></p>



<p>Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump’s FDA commissioner,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/congressional-testimony/examining-patient-access-investigational-drugs-10032017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a>&nbsp;Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own “expanded access” program.</p>



<p>“Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,” Gottlieb testified.</p>



<p><strong>The Middle East under Trump</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/4500/end/4560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire: “Less than four years ago, we had peace in the Middle East with the historic Abraham Accords. Today we have an all-out war in Israel and it’s gonna spread very quickly. What a difference a president makes, isn’t it amazing though?” He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1sC7k2qYN0w?feature=shared&amp;t=1262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition: “The experts said our pro-Israel policies would produce terror and chaos, but I knew the opposite was true. I turned out to be right.<br>We got the historic Abraham Accords and peace in the Middle East. Peace in the Middle East.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims that there was “peace in the Middle East” during his presidency and that his administration “got” peace in the Middle East are both false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/15/politics/israel-uae-bahrain-white-house-analysis-intl/index.html"><em>agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel</em></a><em>&nbsp;(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East – notably including the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/middleeast/israel-palestinians-gaza-rockets/index.html"><em>Gaza</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/middleeast/israelis-palestinians-violence-intl/index.html"><em>the West Bank</em></a><em>, between Israel and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/middleeast/israel-lebanon-border-fire-intl/index.html"><em>Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/middleeast/israel-syria-border.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>between Israel and Syria</em></a><em>, and what former State Department official&nbsp;</em><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/experts/1744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Aaron David Miller</em></a><em>&nbsp;called “</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israels-war-between-the-wars-with-iran-expands-across-middle-east-11649595603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>the war between the wars</em></a><em>&nbsp;between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.”</em></p>



<p>“It’s a highly inaccurate statement,” said Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Miller also noted that various Middle Eastern states were in “varying phases of dysfunction or failure” at the end of the Trump presidency. As Trump left office, civil wars in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/02/world/syria-idlib-children/index.html">Syria</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/middleeast/yemen-coronavirus-intl/index.html">Yemen</a>&nbsp;were ongoing, Libya was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/world/middleeast/libya-ceasefire.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">precariously emerging from its own civil war</a>, and US forces and diplomats in Iraq&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/20/iraqi-army-8-rockets-target-us-embassy-in-baghdad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued to be attacked</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://arabcenterdc.org/team/dana-el-kurd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana El Kurd</a>, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called Trump’s claim “false.” She said in an email: “The Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of – death tolls, settlement violence, etc).”</p>



<p><strong>Trump and wars</strong></p>



<p>Trump claimed in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October speech in Florida</a>&nbsp;that while there are “all of these wars” today under Biden, during the Trump presidency, “We had no wars. I got out of every war. We defeated ISIS, we got out.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Facts First:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Trump’s claim that he “got out of every war” is false. At the end of his presidency, US troops remained in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he had reduced the size of the US presence in all three. And Trump&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/afghanistan-iraq-withdrawal-pentagon/index.html"><em>kept a contingent of troops in Syria</em></a>&nbsp;<em>throughout his presidency, even after</em>&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/us-armored-vehicles-syria/index.html"><em>claimed</em></a>&nbsp;<em>US troops were “out” (other than to protect oil sites, he added); in fact, two US troops&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/remembering-us-troops-who-died-in-iraq-and-syria-in-2020-1.657100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>died in vehicle rollovers in Syria in 2020</em></a>.</p>



<p>Trump was also commander-in-chief for US airstrikes, including drone strikes in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/us/politics/us-somalia-airstrikes-shabab.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Somalia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/americas-counterterrorism-wars/the-war-in-yemen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yemen</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/airstrikes-and-civilian-casualties-libya/the-us-counterterrorism-war-and-libya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libya</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/americas-counterterrorism-wars/the-drone-war-in-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pakistan</a>, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/21/politics/more-us-service-members-injured-iran-strike">retaliation against US service members</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Trump and Veterans Choice</strong></p>



<p>In a November&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;in New Hampshire, Trump claimed, “I also signed – about 59 years they’ve been trying to get this one – VA Choice, which made it permanent, so that veterans can get medical care at the private health care provider of their choice.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s “59 years they’ve been trying to get it” claim is false. The Veterans Choice program was actually&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/politics/obama-va-bill/index.html"><em>signed into law in 2014</em></a><em>&nbsp;by his predecessor, Obama. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, that expanded and modified the program established under Obama, and, as Trump said,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44562.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>made the initiative permanent</em></a><em>. But contrary to Trump’s claim, it’s not true that people had been attempting for decades to create such an initiative.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>During Trump’s presidency, he falsely took credit for the Choice law&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/politics/fact-check-trump-mccain-loser-veterans-choice/index.html">more than 150 times</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Trump’s aid to farmers</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531077-1/president-donald-trump-campaigns-adel-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Trump claimed that he had given US farmers $28 billion from China. For example, he claimed in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in New Hampshire</a>, “How can the farmers vote against me? I got them $28 billion from China.” He added, “I got the money from China out of the tariffs that I got.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims are wrong in two ways. First and most critically, this money wasn’t from China. Though the Trump administration made the payments&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/farmers-trade-aid-trump/index.html"><em>because farmers had been hurt by his trade war with China</em></a><em>, the aid money came from US taxpayers:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Study</em></a><em>&nbsp;after&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>study</em></a><em>, including&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub5405.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>one this year from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission</em></a><em>, has&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-16/supply-chain-latest-us-importers-bore-cost-of-trump-s-china-tariffs-itc-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>found</em></a><em>&nbsp;that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. (And it is US importers, not Chinese exporters, who make the actual tariff payments to the government.)&nbsp; Second, as The Washington Post&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/13/trump-conjures-up-phony-dispute-with-ron-desantis-over-china-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>noted in a recent fact check</em></a><em>, the payments to farmers under Trump’s program totaled $23 billion, not “$28 billion,”&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104259.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>per the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Previous presidents and tariffs on China</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In</a>&nbsp;October speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump boasted of the revenue produced by his tariffs on China and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeated</a>&nbsp;his familiar claim that not a single previous president had gotten China to pay the US “10 cents.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Temporarily leaving aside the fact that Americans, not China, overwhelmingly paid for Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products, it’s not true no previous president had generated “10 cents” from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on goods from China&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1819831.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>since the late 1700s</em></a><em>; Obama&nbsp;</em><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/10/07/news/economy/obama_china_tires_tariff.fortune/index.htm"><em>imposed</em></a><em>&nbsp;new tariffs on goods from China; FactCheck.org&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/video-fact-checking-trumps-louisiana-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>reported&nbsp;</em></a><em>that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Trump’s aid to the lobster industry</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/NE1u8wXdLtAq-VXpXBJWH63N3K77cDDk1xO6NljrZTU60HlKuBUb9dc-nRnzo3tllgmqmmg06ZuVhiok-UrflBkrYJs?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=4739.25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire that, of the money he supposedly secured from China, he “gave the farmers and New England lobstermen $28 billion. You know, I gave your lobstermen $28 billion.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First:&nbsp;</strong><em>This is false. Trump’s trade-aid package for the seafood industry&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.farmers.gov/archived/protection-recovery/seafood/strp-faq#:~:text=Q%3A%20How%20much%20is%20USDA,direct%20support%20for%20commercial%20fishermen." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>was a $530 million program</em></a><em>&nbsp;covering the entire country. So while it’s not clear how much New England lobstermen in particular ended up receiving, the total was clearly far less than the “$28 billion” he claimed he gave to farmers or the $23 billion he actually did give to farmers. (Lobstermen were not eligible for money from the trade-aid package for farmers.) And it’s worth noting that the money for the seafood industry, like the money for farmers, was compensation for&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/05/21/maine-lobster-industry-trade-war-newday-vpx.cnn"><em>losses incurred because of Trump’s own policies</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>China’s oil purchases from Iran under Trump</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Trump told a story about how he supposedly got China to completely stop buying oil from Iran by telling China that if they bought any, the US would no longer do business with China. For example, he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in Florida: “I said, ‘If you buy oil, any oil, from Iran, we’re never doing business. You have all the stuff that you take out of this country and rip us off. We’re not going to do any more business with China.’ They stopped immediately. No more oil.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that China completely stopped buying oil from Iran during his presidency is false. China’s oil imports from Iran did briefly plummet under Trump in 2019, the year the Trump administration&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/trump-administration-iranian-oil-sanction-waiver/index.html"><em>made a concerted effort to deter such purchases</em></a><em>, but they never stopped – and then they rose sharply again while Trump was still president. “The claim is untrue because Chinese crude imports from Iran haven’t stopped at all,” Matt Smith,</em>&nbsp;<em>lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, a market intelligence firm, said in November.</em></p>



<p>China’s official statistics&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-reports-first-official-iranian-oil-imports-since-dec-2020-2022-01-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded no purchases</a>&nbsp;of Iranian crude in Trump’s last partial month in office, January 2021, and also none in most of Biden’s first year in office. But that doesn’t mean China’s imports actually ceased; industry experts say it is widely known that China has used a variety of tactics to mask its continued imports from Iran. Smith said Iranian crude is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often listed in Chinese data as being from Malaysia</a>; ships may travel from Iran with their transponders switched off and then turn them on when they are near Malaysia, Smith said, or&nbsp;<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Iranian-oil-flowing-past-Malaysia-on-way-to-Asian-customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transfer the Iranian oil to other ships</a>.</p>



<p>Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a November email: “China significantly reduced its imports from Iran from around 800,000 barrels per day in 2018 to 100,000 in late 2019. But by the time Trump left office, they were back to upwards to 600(000)-700,000 barrels.”</p>



<p>Vaez’s comments were corroborated by Kpler data Smith provided to CNN. Kpler found that China imported about 511,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude in December 2020, Trump’s last full month in office. The low point under Trump was March 2020, when global oil demand crashed because of Covid-19. Even then, China imported about 87,000 barrels per day, Kpler found. (Since data on Iranian oil exports is based on cargo tracking by various companies and groups, other entities may have different data.)</p>



<p><strong>Iran’s oil sales under Trump and Biden</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed in an October speech in Florida</a>&nbsp;that Biden’s soft approach to sanctions on Iran “allowed them to sell massive amounts of oil, making them $80 billion a year. Congratulations; they were making nothing with us.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Both of Trump’s claims – that Iran is making $80 billion a year from oil sales under Biden and that it was making “nothing” from these sales under Trump – are false.</em></p>



<p>The federal government’s Energy Information Administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/OPEC_Revenues_Fact_Sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;that Iran generated an approximate&nbsp;<em>total</em>&nbsp;of $110 billion in net oil export revenues in 2021, 2022 and the first five months of 2023. The 2021 figure was $37 billion and the 2022 figure was $54 billion. That’s not “$80 billion a year.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the conservative Washington Free Beacon&nbsp;<a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/iran-has-made-80-billion-in-illicit-oil-sales-since-biden-took-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;in October that the group United Against a Nuclear Iran had calculated that Iran had generated about $80 billion in oil sales over the course of the Biden administration. The group confirmed to CNN in November that this $80 billion was for the period from February 2021 to September 2023, not for a single year alone.</p>



<p>And Iran made money from oil exports under Trump as well. Data provided to CNN by the Energy Information Administration shows that Iran had $55 billion in net oil export revenues in 2017, $66 billion in 2018, $29 billion in 2019 and $16 billion in 2020.</p>



<h5 id="elections-campaigns-and-voting">Elections, campaigns and voting</h5>



<p><strong>Groceries and identification</strong></p>



<p>In an October&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech in Iowa</a>, Trump reprised a claim for which he was widely mocked during his presidency –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/politics/fact-check-trump-groceries-id-voter-fraud/index.html">his</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/trump-grocery-shopping-id/index.html">assertion</a>&nbsp;that Americans are required to show identification to buy groceries. “If you buy a loaf of bread, you gotta have your ID out, but for voting, you don’t,” Trump said.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump remains wrong. Americans do not need to show identification to buy bread or other foods.</em></p>



<p>Grocery stores generally require identification for purchases of alcohol or tobacco, for purchases of certain medications and for the small percentage of purchases made with a check. They may sometimes ask for ID when customers are using credit cards.&nbsp; But those are exceptions rather than the rule. Contrary to Trump’s declarations, Americans can and do purchase loaves of bread, and otherwise fill their grocery bags with food, without ever having to tell anyone who they are – much less show official proof of identity.</p>



<p><strong>The legitimacy of the 2020 election</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Trump claimed the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” or “<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stolen</a>,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531311-1/president-trump-campaigns-miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specifying</a>&nbsp;that “radical left Democrats” rigged the election and once&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531311-1/president-trump-campaigns-miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>&nbsp;“they cheated like a bunch of dogs.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First:</strong>&nbsp;<em>These claims are all false. The 2020 election was not rigged, Trump lost fair and square to Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, and there is no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state.</em></p>



<p><strong>The 2020 vote count</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?530983-1/donald-trump-campaigns-wolfeboro-nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a>&nbsp;speeches in New Hampshire and a&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231109_102100_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/3120/end/3180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Florida</a>, Trump rejected the legitimacy of the vote count in the 2020 presidential election He said in New Hampshire in November: “I got 75 million votes, I got – and that’s their count, OK, which is a phony count.” He&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231109_102100_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/3120/end/3180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in Florida in November: “I went from 63 million to, I believe, over 75 million – and that’s been recorded by them, not by me. How about the real number?”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim of a “phony count” is false, as is his suggestion that the official numbers are not the “real number.” The vote count was legitimate and accurate.</em></p>



<p>A minor side note: Trump got&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">74,223,975 votes</a>, not “over 75 million”; Biden got 81,283,501.</p>



<p><strong>Election Night in 2020</strong></p>



<p>Falsely claiming that he watched the 2020 election get “stolen,” Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231109_102100_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/3300/end/3660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Florida that, on Election Night, “at 9 o’clock it was over, 10 o’clock it was really over” – suggesting, as he has repeatedly before, that he had been shown to be the winner at those times. He added, “And then…’We have found some additional votes.’”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim is false. The 2020 election was not “over” at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. on November 3, when millions of legitimate votes still needed to be counted – and it was&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/politics/2020-election-count-red-mirage-blue-shift/index.html"><em>widely known</em></a><em>&nbsp;in the lead-up to Election Day that some states’ early results might create the illusion that Trump had big leads, since it would take time to count the mail-in votes that tended to heavily favor Biden (in part because Trump had&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/app-politics-section/donald-trump-mail-in-voter-fraud-fact-check/index.html"><em>spent months</em></a><em>&nbsp;disparaging mail-in voting). Some populous urban areas, which also tended to support Biden, also took a while to finish their counting simply because they had so many votes.</em></p>



<p>Trump has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/politics/fact-check-trump-election-night-speech/index.html">making similar false claims since Election Night 2020 itself</a>, when he wrongly claimed that he had won Georgia and won Michigan as votes continued to be counted. Trump ended up losing both states.</p>



<p><strong>A film about the 2020 election</strong></p>



<p>Repeating his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/mdYJPNtAPYQ?feature=shared&amp;t=607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Iowa: “We don’t even have to go into all of the ballot-stuffing that is on tape from the ‘2000 Mules.’ You look at ‘2000 Mules’ and you see thousands and thousands – hundreds of thousands actually – of votes being stuffed into ballot boxes.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. The film ‘2000 Mules’&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-usa-mules/fact-check-does-2000-mules-provide-evidence-of-voter-fraud-in-the-2020-u-s-presidential-election-idUSL2N2XJ0OQ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>has</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/03/judge-rules-defamation-lawsuit-against-2000-mules-can-proceed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>been</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/arizona-dropbox-watchers-fraud/index.html"><em>widely debunked</em></a><em>, and it doesn’t show thousands of votes, let alone hundreds of thousands, “being stuffed into ballot boxes.”</em></p>



<p>The film, which is filled with misleading claims and dubious analysis, focuses on footage of ballots being submitted into drop boxes<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in public places (after which they are put through various verification measures to make sure they are legitimate), not into ballot boxes at in-person voting centers where ballots are placed for final counting – and, regardless, the film fails to prove any widespread wrongdoing even involving the drop boxes.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>The security of mail-in ballots</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231109_102100_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/4860/end/4920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Florida, “Anytime you have mail-in ballots, you have corrupt elections. I don’t care what it is. Anybody that wants it, they’re corrupt. And that includes Republicans, by the way. Anytime you have mail-in ballots, you are going to have really corrupt elections.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is all false. While&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/how-a-nullified-election-in-connecticut-became-a-rallying-cry-for-trump-supporters/index.html"><em>elections</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/app-politics-section/donald-trump-mail-in-voter-fraud-fact-check/index.html"><em>experts say</em></a><em>&nbsp;the occurrence of fraud is relatively higher with mail-in ballots than with in-person voting,&nbsp;</em><em>they also say that fraud of any kind in American state and federal elections represents a&nbsp;</em><em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/politics/trump-delay-election-fact-check/index.html">miniscule</a></em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>percentage of total votes cast.&nbsp;</em><em>Voters have been casting ballots by mail for decades, including in Republican-dominated states; there is nothing inherently corrupt about supporting the use of such ballots.</em></p>



<p><strong>‘Fake ballots’</strong></p>



<p>In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;the only way he can be beaten in the November 2024 election is “if they cheat.” He added moments later, “The biggest problem is they make fake ballots. Okay? That’s the biggest problem. And a lot of Republicans are very naive when they don’t say that. They say, ‘Oh, vote early. Vote early. We want to build…’ No, no: the big problem we have to do, we gotta stop fake ballots from being made.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is entirely baseless. Federal elections do not have any “big problem” with “fake ballots.” Every state has&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/mail-ballot-security-features-primer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>numerous safeguards in place</em></a><em>&nbsp;to ensure that someone who tries to manufacture and use a phony ballot will be caught.</em></p>



<p><strong>What a Jimmy Carter commission said</strong></p>



<p>Criticizing the use of mail-in ballots, Trump invoked a commission on election reform that was co-chaired by former Democratic President Jimmy Carter.</p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231105_093600_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_at_Florida_Freedom_Summit/start/2580/end/2640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Florida that Carter “had a commission with some other prominent senators, and they came to one conclusion: you can’t do mail-in ballots.” Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in New Hampshire: “Even Jimmy Carter, he had a commission. He said if you have mail-in ballots, you’re going to have massive corruption.”<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims significantly exaggerated what Carter’s commission said.<br>Though the commission Carter co-chaired was generally skeptical of mail-in ballots, it did not say “you can’t do mail-in ballots” or that “massive corruption” is inevitable with the use of mail-in ballots; in fact, it highlighted an example of successful mail-only elections.</em></p>



<p>The commission’s 2005&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200413145148/https:/www.legislationline.org/download/id/1472/file/3b50795b2d0374cbef5c29766256.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;said that “absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.” It also said mail-in voting increases the risks of fraud and that absentee ballots are “vulnerable to abuse in several ways.”</p>



<p>But it did not say all mail-in voting should be prohibited. It said that Oregon, a state that has been conducting elections exclusively by mail-in voting since the late 1990s, “appears to have avoided significant fraud in its vote-by-mail elections by introducing safeguards to protect ballot integrity, including signature verification.” The report also offered some recommendations for making the use of mail-in ballots more secure and called for “further research on the pros and cons” of voting by mail (as well as early voting).</p>



<p>Fifteen years after the release of the report, Carter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2020/jimmy-carter-on-absentee-ballots.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a 2020 statement: “I approve the use of absentee ballots and have been using them for more than five years.” His organization, The Carter Center,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2020/united-states-050620.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a 2020 statement: “Fortunately, since 2005, many states have gained substantial experience in vote-by-mail and have shown how key concerns can be effectively addressed through appropriate planning, resources, training, and messaging.”</p>



<p><strong>Democrats and elections</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/3420/end/3480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire that Democrats can’t win legitimately, given their policy preferences, and “the only way they know how to win is by cheating.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. Just like Republicans, Democrats have won elections around the country – including the 2020 presidential election – fair and square. There is simply no basis for Trump’s claim.</em></p>



<p><strong>Trump’s 2016 margin in Alabama</strong></p>



<p>In a November speech in Florida, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231109_102100_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/3120/end/3180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a>&nbsp;of how some of his opponents claimed that the 2016 election he won was rigged. He then said, “In 2016, they even tried to get me on Alabama and I won it by like 45 points. They said, ‘He cheated on Alabama.’ I said, ‘I won it by 45 points, I must have cheated by a lot.’”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that he won Alabama by 45 percentage points in 2016 is false – a major exaggeration. His margin over Hillary Clinton was big, but it was&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/voter-pdfs/2016/2016-Official-General-Election-Results-Certified-2016-11-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>about 27.8 points</em></a><em>&nbsp;(62.08% to 34.36%), not 45 points.</em></p>



<p>It’s not clear who he was claiming had accused him of cheating to win Alabama.</p>



<p><strong>Maricopa County in 2022</strong></p>



<p>In a November speech in Florida, Trump mentioned Kari Lake, a Republican US Senate candidate in Arizona who ran unsuccessfully for Arizona governor in 2022. He made reference to a technology problem that marred Election Day 2022 in Arizona’s most populous county, Maricopa County,&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20231109_014900_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/660/end/720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>&nbsp;that “unfortunately over 50% of the machines, in the Republican areas only, didn’t work. So they always find something.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s specifics were wrong: the Maricopa County&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/politics/maricopa-county-printer-investigation-2022-election/index.html#:~:text=The%20investigation%20found%20that%20some,news%20release%20from%20the%20county."><em>technology problem</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/82599/Maricopa-Election-Report-and-Attachments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>affected about 27% of its voting locations</em></a><em>&nbsp;– and these locations were scattered around the county, in heavily Democratic areas as well as Republican areas, a&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2022/11/13/arizona-voting-problems-kari-lake-katie-hobbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Washington Post analysis</em></a><em>&nbsp;found</em><em>. And Trump’s suggestion that the technology problems were intentionally designed to damage Republicans is baseless. At the time, Maricopa County&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/fact-check-election-voter-fraud-conspiracies/index.html"><em>had a Republican-controlled board of supervisors and a Republican county recorder</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>“We were having these issues coming up around Maricopa County,” Bill Gates, the Republican chairman of the board of supervisors,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1293863514793124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a>&nbsp;reporters at the time. Noting the Republican affiliations of the recorder and the majority of the board, Gates said, “So there was no partisan bias in what happened here. This was a technical issue.”</p>



<p><strong>Chris Wallace and a 2020 debate</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two</a>&nbsp;October&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?530983-1/donald-trump-campaigns-wolfeboro-nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speeches</a>&nbsp;in New Hampshire and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a>&nbsp;speeches in Florida, Trump told a story in which he claimed that 2020 presidential debate moderator Chris Wallace, who was then a host for Fox News and is now a host for CNN, had tried to stop him from asking Biden a question about a supposed payment from the wife of the mayor of Moscow to Biden’s son Hunter Biden.</p>



<p>“Chris Wallace said, ‘He’s not allowed to answer that question,‘” Trump said in one of the New Hampshire speeches; in the other, he&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/2580/end/2640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;Wallace said “you’re not allowed to ask that question” and told him “it’s inappropriate.” In Florida in November, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231105_093600_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_at_Florida_Freedom_Summit/start/1920/end/1980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “Biden couldn’t answer the question, but Chris Wallace came in and helped him. ‘You’re not allowed to ask that question.’”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>All of these Trump claims are false. Wallace did not tell him that he was not allowed to ask the question or that Biden was not allowed to answer it.<br>Rather, as the transcript&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/september-29-2020-debate-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>shows</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<em>Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to&nbsp;<strong>allow&nbsp;</strong>Biden to answer the question after Trump had asked it, rather than continue to speak when Biden tried to offer a response. Wallace never said the question was “inappropriate.”</em></p>



<p>Rather, Wallace made comments like, “Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it” and, “Well, you have raised an issue, let the vice president answer.”</p>

<p><strong>Climate change and sea levels</strong></p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Florida</a>, Trump delivered another version of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/fact-check-trump-sea-levels-ocean-climate-change/index.html">familiar claim</a>&nbsp;he has used to minimize the threat of climate change. He said that others, rather than talk about the potentially catastrophic threat of nuclear weapons, instead “talk about global warming – because in 250 years our ocean’s gonna be a hundredth of an inch higher.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that the ocean will be just a hundredth of an inch higher “in 250 years” is false. As the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has&nbsp;</em><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>noted</em></a><em>, the global sea level is currently rising at a rate of about an eighth of an inch&nbsp;<strong>per year</strong>. In other words, the sea level rise Trump claimed will happen “in 250 years” is already being vastly exceeded on an annual basis. NOAA&nbsp;</em><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>says</em></a><em>&nbsp;that, along the US coastline in particular, sea level rise is expected to average a total of 10 to 12 inches between 2020 and 2050 alone.</em></p>



<p><strong>Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</strong></p>



<p>In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump criticized Biden for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/politics/drilling-alaska-national-wildlife-refuge/index.html">canceling</a>&nbsp;Trump-era oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He said, “Can you believe that? It was so much work to get that approved. We got it approved. They were ready to start drilling.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>It’s not true that anybody was “ready to start drilling” in the refuge, either before the Biden administration&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/politics/drilling-alaska-national-wildlife-refuge/index.html"><em>suspended leases there in 2021</em></a><em>&nbsp;or before the administration canceled leases in 2023. There is no drilling infrastructure in place in the refuge, major oil companies have shown little interest in the site, and the seven leases the Biden administration canceled were&nbsp;</em><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/09/06/biden-administration-cancels-last-leases-in-alaskas-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>all held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority</em></a><em>, a state entity that is not an oil company. “To quote our friends at PolitiFact, what Trump said in this case qualifies as ‘</em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=PolitiFact+pants+on+fire&amp;rlz=1C1YTUH_en&amp;oq=PolitiFact+pants+on+fire&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE1MjJqMGo0qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>pants on fire</em></a><em>,’” Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates, said in a November email. He said, “No one was ready to start drilling there, in 2017 or at any other point in time.”</em></p>



<p>Molchanov explained that the idea of drilling in the refuge would be a textbook example of “frontier exploration,” drilling in an area that has no previous activity by the oil industry. “This means there is no first-hand knowledge of how to go about drilling there. Everything would have to be learned along the way. This translates into lengthy time for preparation and elevated costs for actual drilling, if and when it were to take place. Also, there is no infrastructure – it would have to be developed from scratch.”</p>



<p>Tim Woody, communications manager for the Alaska regional office of The Wilderness Society conservation group, also called Trump’s claim false and noted “there is no infrastructure in place” in the refuge. And Woody said that no company had “gone through any of the steps that occur between acquiring a lease and actually beginning development,” including conducting seismic analysis and obtaining permits.</p>



<p><strong>Demand for electric cars</strong></p>



<p>In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “Can you believe what we’re doing with the electric cars? All electric. Nobody wants them.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>It’s not true that “nobody wants” electric cars. US purchases of electric vehicles&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/20/cars/electric-cars-sales-gas-cars-dg/index.html"><em>continue to set records</em></a><em>; Cox Automotive&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2023-ev-sales/#:~:text=Electric%20vehicle%20(EV)%20sales%20volumes,for%20the%20first%20time%20ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>reported in October</em></a><em>&nbsp;that “EV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters” in the US and were “firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever” in a year. Electric vehicle sales also make up a growing share of total US vehicle sales; Cox Automotive reported that they accounted for a record 7.9% of total sales in the third quarter of 2023, up from 6.1% a year prior and up from 7.2% in the second quarter of this year.</em></p>



<p>A Pew Research Center survey earlier this year&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/13/how-americans-view-electric-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a>&nbsp;that 38% of Americans said they are very likely or somewhat likely to seriously consider an electric vehicle for their next vehicle purchase. Even if the poll result is off, it’s clear that Trump’s claim that “nobody wants them” is not true.</p>



<p><strong>The US and electric car manufacturing</strong></p>



<p>Trump, saying he thinks he will earn the support of union autoworkers,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/mdYJPNtAPYQ?feature=shared&amp;t=1863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Iowa that it is “preposterous” for the US move to all electric cars – and then said, “You can’t make them here, because we don’t have the minerals, we don’t have the materials for it.

<p><strong>Biden and electric vehicles</strong></p>



<p>Trump claimed in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October speech in New Hampshire</a>: “On day one, I will repeal Joe Biden’s insane electric vehicle mandate. ‘Everybody has to have an electric car.’” He said that, in a second Trump administration, “gasoline-powered engines will be allowed.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim is false. Biden has not mandated that “everybody has to have an electric car” or outlawed cars powered by gasoline, though his administration has made an aggressive push to try to get automakers and consumers to move toward electric vehicles.</em></p>



<p>The Biden administration has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/car-pollution-standards-electric-vehicles-biden-climate/index.html">proposed ambitious new tailpipe emissions regulations for automakers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/business/ev-tax-credit-up-front-climate/index.html">offered tax credits to people who buy certain electric vehicles</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/joe-biden-detroit-auto-show/index.html">invested in new electric vehicle charging stations</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2023/07/federal-agencies-plan-spend-770m-ramping-their-electric-vehicle-usage-year/388740/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered federal entities to purchase electric vehicles</a>, among other policies promoting the adoption of these vehicles. But there is no Biden requirement that “everybody” has to drive an electric vehicle and no Biden proposal to prohibit citizens from continuing to use gasoline-powered engines.</p>



<p>Depending on how automakers were to respond, the Environmental Protection Agency’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/car-pollution-standards-electric-vehicles-biden-climate/index.html">proposed new tailpipe rules</a>&nbsp;could, if adopted, require electric vehicles to make up two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032.</p>



<p><strong>Electric vehicles and the military</strong></p>



<p>In a November speech in Texas, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized</a>&nbsp;the Biden administration for imposing “insane mandates” and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5092750/user-clip-trump-tanks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lamented</a>&nbsp;that “Army tanks have to go electric, OK?…Because the tanks, if they’re electric, you’re going into a country blasting the hell out of it, but at least we’re doing it in an environmentally friendly way.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. The Biden administration is not requiring tanks to be all-electric, as FactCheck.org&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/11/trumps-false-claim-that-u-s-military-moving-to-electric-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>pointed out in its own November fact check</em></a><em>.<br>The Army released a climate strategy in 2022 that called for a move toward various kinds of electric vehicles, including “fully electric tactical vehicles by 2050,” but that would not include tanks</em>.&nbsp;<em>And, regardless, a strategy is not a mandate.</em></p>



<p><strong>Biden and boats</strong></p>



<p>During the same part of the Texas speech, Trump also claimed that “all boats have to go electric.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. There is no Biden mandate requiring boats to be powered by electricity, as The New York Times&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/us/politics/trump-fact-check-energy-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>noted</em></a><em>&nbsp;in its own fact check of this Trump speech.</em></p>



<p><strong>A federal boat speed limit</strong><em></em></p>



<p>After complaining in an October speech in New Hampshire about offshore wind turbines, and alleging&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/addressing-misinformation-offshore-wind-farms-and-recent-whale-mortalities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without evidence</a>&nbsp;that these turbines are killing whales, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231010_023200_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/1080/end/1140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>, “Then they say that, for boat manufacturers, the boat can’t go more than two miles an hour because we don’t want to hurt the whales.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This claim is false in two ways.</em></p>



<p>To try to protect whales, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/rule-amend-north-atlantic-right-whale-vessel-speed-regulations-closed-comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a>&nbsp;to require a greater number of boats to abide by a speed limit in certain areas of the East Coast during certain months of the year; the expansion would apply the speed limit to boats at least 35 feet long rather than the current minimum of 65 feet long.</p>



<p>But Trump’s “two miles an hour” claim is not true. The speed limit involved is 10 knots, or roughly 11.5 miles per hour. Second, the speed limit applies to people operating boats, not to “boat manufacturers” as Trump said. In other words, the government is not trying to force companies to make boats that cannot go faster than this speed limit.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a>&nbsp;recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speeches</a>, Trump has attributed his two-miles-per-hour claim to something he said he was told while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nmma.org/press/article/24471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visiting</a>&nbsp;a boat company in South Carolina in September. That company and South Carolina’s boating industry advocacy group did not respond to CNN requests for comment.</p>



<p><strong>California and electricity</strong></p>



<p>Criticizing Democrats’ push for the adoption of electric vehicles, Trump repeatedly claimed that California already has constant blackouts because it has insufficient power to serve its population.</p>



<p>He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Texas: “Did you see, they had blackouts all over the place this summer?” He&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/3420/end/3480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire: “In California, they want to go with all-electric, but they can’t even – every weekend, they have a blackout. They don’t have enough electricity.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims that California “had blackouts all over the place this summer” and has a blackout “every weekend” are false. California has been able to meet its electricity demand throughout the year, including during the peak-demand summer season.</em></p>



<p>“California didn’t experience any outages this year because of a load imbalance. We haven’t since 2020,” Erin Mellon, spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said in an email earlier in November. Mellon added, “We’ve drastically expanded our clean energy portfolio, and recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/10/24/california-reaches-energy-storage-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CA hit 6,600 MW of battery storage</a>&nbsp;– enough for 6.6 million homes for 4 hours.”</p>



<p>Vonette Fontaine, spokesperson for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caiso.com/about/Pages/OurBusiness/The-ISO-grid.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Independent System Operator</a>, which manages the power grid for about 80% of the state, said in an email earlier in November: “The California Independent System Operator did not experience any grid emergencies this summer requiring electricity outages.”</p>

<p><strong>Biden and energy production</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/NE1u8wXdLtAq-VXpXBJWH63N3K77cDDk1xO6NljrZTU60HlKuBUb9dc-nRnzo3tllgmqmmg06ZuVhiok-UrflBkrYJs?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=762.78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire that, with regard to US energy production, Biden “stopped it – just no more.” In an October speech in Iowa, he more specifically accused Biden of stopping energy production from fossil fuels,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531077-1/president-donald-trump-campaigns-adel-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>, “Biden – by stopping all the energy coming out – you know, he wants to put windmills all over the place and he wants to do things that are very expensive, but he doesn’t want any petroleum, he doesn’t want any petroleum product, and he doesn’t want oil and gas.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims are false. Biden has not stopped US production of oil and gas, which has&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/09/business/oil-production-biden-trump/index.html"><em>continued to boom under Biden</em></a><em>. US crude oil production in 2022 was the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus2&amp;f=a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>second-highest year on record</em></a><em>, behind only Trump-era 2019, and domestic crude production in the first eight months of 2023, the most recent data that is currently available, was&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus2&amp;f=m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>the highest</em></a><em>&nbsp;on record for the first eight months of any year.</em></p>



<p>As CNN’s Matt Egan&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/09/business/oil-production-biden-trump/index.html">reported in August</a>, the federal government’s Energy Information Administration is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/?src=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">projecting annual records</a>&nbsp;for both 2023 and 2024.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US production of dry natural gas</a>&nbsp;also set a record in 2022 and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9070us2m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outpaced 2022 levels</a>&nbsp;in the first eight months of 2023.</p>



<p>None of this is to say that Biden is the reason that domestic production has increased; market factors are the key driver of companies’ investment and production decisions. (“It’s perhaps less about the administration in power and more about the entrepreneurial nature of the oil industry,” Matt Smith, Kpler’s lead oil analyst for the Americas, told Egan.) And Egan wrote: “The American Petroleum Institute, an oil trade group that has been critical of the Biden administration’s regulatory efforts, noted that approved federal permits and new federal acres leased have both fallen sharply under Biden.”</p>



<p>Still, despite Biden’s often&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/energy/biden-ally-big-oil-surtax/index.html">critical rhetoric</a>&nbsp;about fossil fuel companies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/climate/biden-drilling-federal-lands.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some policy moves to get tougher on those companies</a>&nbsp;and his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/business/climate-clean-energy-jobs-biden/index.html#:~:text=The%20nearly%20%24370%20billion%20clean,emissions%20by%2040%25%20by%202030.">major investments in initiatives to fight climate change</a>, he certainly has not “stopped it.”</p>



<p>Biden has also approved some significant and controversial fossil fuel projects, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/politics/willow-project-oil-alaska-explained-climate/index.html">Willow oil drilling project in Alaska</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/politics/supreme-court-mountain-valley-pipeline/index.html">Mountain Valley gas pipeline</a>&nbsp;from West Virginia to Virginia.</p>



<p><strong>Biden and oil exports to Europe</strong></p>



<p>Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Texas</a>: “We’re going to supply Europe, all over the world. We were going to send our oil and gas. And then they ended it, they ended it.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. Biden did not end oil and gas exports to Europe or the rest of the world. In fact, the federal government’s Energy Information Administration&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60622#:~:text=Europe%20was%20the%20largest%20regional,to%20China%20and%20South%20Korea." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>reported in October</em></a><em>&nbsp;that US crude oil exports in the first half of 2023 were the highest on record since the ban on these exports was repealed in 2015 – and that</em>&nbsp;“<em>Europe was the largest regional destination for U.S. crude oil exports by volume, at 1.75 million” barrels per day. Also, the Energy Information Administration&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60361#:~:text=Like%20in%202022%2C%20EU%20countries,of%20total%20U.S.%20LNG%20exports." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>reported in September</em></a><em>&nbsp;that European Union countries and the United Kingdom “remained the main destination” for US exports of liquefied natural gas after&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>reaching that status in 2022</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Oil prices</strong></p>



<p>Talking about oil prices, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/1260/end/1320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October 9 speech in New Hampshire: “Now it’s $100 and going higher.” He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a speech in Florida two days later: “We’re hitting $100 now, and we’re going to probably hit $115 a barrel.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims that “now it’s $100” and that “we’re hitting $100 now” are false, both exaggerations. On the days he spoke,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@CL.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>West Texas Intermediate crude</em></a><em>&nbsp;did not exceed $87.24 per barrel and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@LCO.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Brent crude</em></a><em>&nbsp;did not exceed $89 per barrel. While Brent crude briefly passed $97 per barrel in late September, it had&nbsp;</em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-100-barrel-look-005720658.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>fallen substantially</em></a><em>&nbsp;by the time Trump made this claim.</em></p>



<p>Some analysts have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/business/oil-price-goldman-sachs/index.html">said</a>&nbsp;in recent months that oil could potentially exceed the $100 per barrel mark next year. But Trump used the word “now,” twice, and that’s not true.</p>



<p><strong>Energy costs</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231113_070400_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Florida: “We’re gonna bring down your costs. We are bringing down your energy costs. We have the highest energy costs anywhere now.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>It’s not true that the US now has the highest energy costs “anywhere.” Even with an increase in the Biden era, US household electricity prices have remained substantially&nbsp;</em><a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU000072610?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&amp;output_view=data&amp;include_graphs=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>lower</em></a><em>&nbsp;than prices in&nbsp;</em><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20231026-1#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of,%E2%82%AC28.9%20per%20100%20kWh." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>many European countries</em></a><em>, plus a variety of other nations. Pavel Molchanov, the Raymond James energy analyst, said in an email that Trump’s claim is not even close to correct; citing data you can see&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/electricity_prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>, he said, “U.S. electricity prices are lower than in practically every other industrialized economy.” (US household prices for natural gas are also&nbsp;</em><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Natural_gas_price_statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>nowhere near the world’s highest</em></a><em>.)</em></p>



<p><strong>The state of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve</strong></p>



<p>Criticizing Biden for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/energy/america-oil-stockpile/index.html">releasing a large quantity of oil</a>&nbsp;from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/840/end/900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “Now it’s at the lowest level…the lowest level in history. There’s almost nothing there.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that “there’s almost nothing there” is false. Though the reserve is at its lowest level since the early 1980s, it&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=WCSSTUS1&amp;f=W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>still has more than 351 million barrels of crude</em></a><em>&nbsp;and is still the world’s largest national oil reserve. Three-hundred-fifty-one million barrels is just not “almost nothing” by any reasonable standard. (Trump has previously&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/05/politics/fact-check-trump-petroleum-reserve-oil/index.html"><em>claimed</em></a><em>&nbsp;this year that the reserve is now “totally empty.”)</em></p>



<p><strong>Wind turbines and house values</strong></p>



<p>In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump railed once more against wind turbines, a longtime subject of his criticism. This time, he&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH/start/1080/end/1140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “If you have one near your house, your house is worthless, because you can’t sell it. Between the noise and the look, you can’t sell it.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that “your house is worthless” if a wind turbine is nearby is not true, though there may be some cases where people have more trouble selling their house because of a nearby wind turbine. Various US studies have found either&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/politics/fact-check-trump-wind-turbines-property-value/index.html"><em>no statistically significant impact on house values</em></a><em>&nbsp;or even an&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/windfarms-raise-incomes-and-house-prices-in-rural-us-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>increase in house values</em></a><em>&nbsp;related to the proximity of wind power.</em></p>



<p>Even if there was a decline in house values in some neighborhoods or counties because of nearby wind turbines, that wouldn’t justify Trump’s categorical claim that a nearby wind turbine makes your house “worthless.”</p>



<p><strong>Gas prices</strong></p>



<p>Trump made repeated false claims in October and November about how much gas cost at the time.</p>



<p>For example, he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531077-1/president-donald-trump-campaigns-adel-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October 16 speech in Iowa that gasoline “just hit $5.50 a gallon” after being $1.87 or lower under Trump. He also made the claim about having had gas at $1.87 in an October 11&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;in Florida – and said that “today, you have $5, $6 and $7.” In a November 11&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;in New Hampshire, Trump again boasted of low gas prices during his tenure and said, “And now you have $5 gasoline.” And in the October 16 speech in Iowa, Trump also said that, in California, gasoline is “up to $7 and $8” per gallon.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>These</em>&nbsp;<em>Trump claims are all false.</em></p>



<p>On the day he spoke in Iowa and said prices had “just hit $5.50 a gallon,” the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in Iowa was about $3.29, and the national average was about $3.60, per data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at the firm GasBuddy, said that, on the day Trump spoke, GasBuddy did not see gas being sold for $5 or more per gallon at any of the 2,036 stations it tracks in Iowa.</p>



<p>On the day he spoke in Florida and said that today’s prices were $5, $6 and $7, the state’s average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.42 per gallon, and the national average was about $3.66 per gallon, according to data provided by AAA. De Haan said none of the 8,237 Florida stations tracked by GasBuddy were selling for $5 or higher that day.</p>



<p>On the day he spoke in New Hampshire and said that “now you have $5 gasoline,” the state’s average for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.34, while the national average was about $3.38, according to data provided by AAA. De Haan said none of the 875 New Hampshire stations tracked by GasBuddy were selling for $5 or higher that day.</p>



<p>And when he made the claim about California prices going up to $7 and $8, the state’s average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $5.62; De Haan said that, of 10,526 California stations tracked by GasBuddy, the firm did not see a single station selling that day at $8 per gallon or higher, with only four, well known for their high prices, at $7 or higher. Just four stations in California – two rural, two in Los Angeles – were selling for over $7 per gallon that day.</p>



<p>Also, Trump’s claim about having had gas at $1.87 is misleading.<br>While the national average did go that low and lower after gasoline demand crashed in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/24/politics/fact-check-trump-gas-prices/index.html">the national average was $2.393 per gallon</a>&nbsp;on the day Trump left office in January 2021.</p>

<p><strong>The Keystone XL pipeline and jobs</strong></p>



<p>Criticizing Biden for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/business/biden-keystone-paris-climate-arctic/index.html">canceling the permit</a>&nbsp;for the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada in 2021, Trump said in a November speech in Texas, “Forty-eight thousand jobs, 48,000 people. They gave their life for that, and they never really sort of recovered. That’s what they wanted to do.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that 48,000 people “gave their life” for Keystone XL jobs is false. The company behind the pipeline&nbsp;</em><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/posts-inflate-job-losses-bidens-keystone-pipeline-reversal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>said</em></a><em>&nbsp;after Biden’s cancellation decision that it would cut 1,000 unionized jobs in Canada and the US as a result.</em></p>



<p>A 2014 report from the Obama administration’s State Department had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/nov/16/russ-girling/transcanada-ceo-says-42000-keystone-xl-pipeline-jo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a>&nbsp;that “a total of 42,100 jobs throughout the United States would be supported by construction of the proposed Project.” But that’s still not 48,000, and it doesn’t mean that 42,100 people were actually working on the project in 2021.</p>



<p>The key word is “supported.” The 42,100-jobs estimate wasn’t an estimate of people who would actually be devoting their workdays to the pipeline. It included an estimated 26,000 jobs that would supposedly have resulted “from indirect and induced spending” by people connected to the project, like spending by employees of construction contractors or suppliers.</p>



<p><strong>China and the Paris climate accord</strong></p>



<p>In a November&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531400-1/president-trump-campaigns-houston" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;in Texas, Trump criticized the Paris climate accord, calling it “one of the greatest rip-offs.” As he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/fact-check-november-trump-impeachment-economic-club/index.html">did as president</a>, he also made false claims about China in relation to the accord – saying this time that “China was exempt” from the accord. He added, “China didn’t have to do anything until 2035, think of it.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims are false.</em></p>



<p>China was not “exempt” from the Paris accord; the agreement came into effect for all participating countries,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/obama-asia-meetings-xi-erdogan-duterte/index.html">including China</a>, in&nbsp;<a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 2016.</a>&nbsp;The accord simply allowed each nation to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions.</p>



<p>And though China picked approximately 2030 as the time by which it planned to have carbon emissions peak (<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1100642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later saying</a>&nbsp;the goal was to hit the peak before 2030), that did not mean China didn’t have to do anything until 2030, much less not do anything until 2035. Similarly, when the Obama administration set a target of reducing US emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/31/fact-sheet-us-reports-its-2025-emissions-target-unfccc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 2025</a>, that did not mean that the US was exempt or didn’t have to do anything until 2025.</p>



<p>China has made&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/asia/china-solar-wind-energy-coal-climate-intl/index.html">massive investments in wind and solar energy</a>&nbsp;since its commitment to the Paris accord – while also drawing criticism from environmentalists for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/environment/coal-07282023072108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramping up its use of coal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Military equipment left in Afghanistan</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531311-1/president-trump-campaigns-miami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?530983-1/donald-trump-campaigns-wolfeboro-nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.</p>



<p><strong>Facts First:&nbsp;</strong><em>Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html"><em>estimated</em></a><em>&nbsp;that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.</em></p>



<p>As other fact-checkers have previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/republicans-inflate-cost-of-taliban-seized-u-s-military-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a>, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.</p>



<p><strong>Guns and Afghanistan</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in New Hampshire that the US had left “700,000 rifles” to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. In an October&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;in Florida, he said it was “700,000 guns and rifles.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s “700,000” figure is inaccurate, an exaggeration. An inspector general report to Congress in 2022&nbsp;</em><a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Aug/16/2003058233/-1/-1/1/LEAD%20INSPECTOR%20GENERAL%20FOR%20OPERATION%20FREEDOM%E2%80%99S%20SENTINEL%20AND%20OPERATION%20ENDURING%20SENTINEL%20-%20APRIL%201,%202022%20%E2%80%93%20JUNE%2030,%202022.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>said</em></a><em>: “Since 2005, the DoD procured 427,300 weapons worth $612 million for the Afghan military and security forces, including 258,300 rifles, 6,300 sniper rifles, 64,300 pistols, 56,155 machine guns, 31,000 rocket propelled grenade launchers, and 224 howitzers. [The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy] noted that 316,260 of these weapons, worth $511.8 million, were in the Afghan forces’ stocks when the former government fell, but their operational condition was unknown.”</em></p>



<p><strong>China and Taiwan</strong></p>



<p>In a November speech in Florida, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231105_093600_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_at_Florida_Freedom_Summit/start/3480/end/3540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;of China: “The day I left, they flew 28 bombers right over the middle of Taiwan, because that was a signal.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump was wrong about key details of this incident.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/asia/china-us-taiwan-military-moves-intl-hnk-mil/index.html"><em>On the third and fourth days of the Biden presidency</em></a><em>, not the very day Trump left office, China sent military planes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone over the Taiwan Strait – not “right over the middle of Taiwan,” a major difference. And the incident involved 28 Chinese planes but not “28 bombers”; The New York Times&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/world/asia/china-taiwan-strait-exercise-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>reported at the time</em></a><em>&nbsp;that the Taiwanese military said eight Chinese bombers were involved; the other planes were&nbsp;</em><em>fighters, anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane.</em><em></em></p>



<p>It’s worth noting that China also sent planes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone during Trump’s presidency. In early 2021, Taiwan News&nbsp;<a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4092620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;that, according to a recent report funded by Taiwan’s government, “In 2020, the Chinese military violated Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) more times than in any year since 1996.”</p>



<p><strong>US alliances under Biden</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20231014_223100_Campaign_2024_Donald_Trump_Campaigns_in_Wolfeboro_NH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in New Hampshire that, under Biden, “Relations with other countries – we’ve lost every country; we don’t even have any allies anymore, they don’t respect us. I mean, we don’t have any. We have nothing going. You take a look, and China is our best ally, I think, with him.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Both of these Trump claims are false. The US continues to have numerous allies around the world and continues to have numerous points of friction with China. There is simply no basis for claiming that China, which Biden&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/15/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>describes as a competitor</em></a><em>&nbsp;to the US, has become the closest US ally under Biden. “China is a strong trading partner with the US, but it is as far from an ally a country can be,” said&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.kristawiegand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Krista Wiegand</em></a><em>, director of the University of Tennessee’s Center for National Security and Foreign Affairs.</em></p>



<p>Wiegand said: “From the beginning of his administration, Biden has worked hard to repair relations with US allies that were weekend under the Trump administration. US relations with its allies are closer than they have been in years especially in the Indo-Pacific region.”</p>



<p><strong>Netanyahu and the assassination of an Iranian general</strong></p>



<p>In an October speech in Florida, Trump criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for supposedly pulling Israel out from its planned involvement in the Trump-ordered 2020&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/baghdad-airport-strike-live-intl-hnk/h_f4d89b41ef9e19a716edc8047bf923df">assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani</a>. Then, using Netanyahu’s nickname, Trump said: “And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That wasn’t good. That didn’t make me feel too good. But that’s alright.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Netanyahu did not try to take credit for the 2020 assassination of Soleimani. In fact, he explicitly&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2686990164741161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>said</em></a><em>&nbsp;the day of the assassination that “President Trump deserves all the credit” – emphasizing the “all” – “for acting swiftly, forcefully, decisively.”</em></p>



<p>NBC News&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/airport-informants-overhead-drones-how-u-s-killed-soleimani-n1113726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;in 2020 that Israeli intelligence had played a role in the killing; the former head of Israeli military intelligence&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-716018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the same</a>&nbsp;in 2021. But Netanyahu has not made such comments himself, let alone take credit for the killing itself. The Jerusalem Post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-716018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;in 2022 that “although NBC News and Yahoo News had published detailed pieces about Israel’s role, all official Israeli echelons had been mum on the issue” until the former intelligence chief spoke out.</p>



<p><strong>Iran’s retaliation for Soleimani’s death</strong></p>



<p>In various speeches, Trump hinted or explicitly claimed that Iran intentionally avoided hitting a base that housed US troops in Iraq when Iran launched missiles toward the base in January 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Soleimani.</p>



<p>In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;the missiles “all landed a little outside the base” and that Iran “needed some kind of reply, I guess, but they didn’t hit us.” In a November speech in Houston, he&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/-f246Mq8W-4?feature=shared&amp;t=4274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;that Iran had called the US to assure them that none of the missiles would strike the base, and indeed all of the missiles either blew up before arrival or landed “outside the base area.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims that all of Iran’s missiles landed outside the base are false. As The Washington Post&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/15/no-iran-didnt-deliberately-avoid-hitting-us-base-trump-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>noted</em></a><em>&nbsp;in its own recent fact check, 11 Iranian missiles hit the al-Asad base Iran had targeted in the retaliatory attack. The fact that missiles hit the base was confirmed by&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/IRAQ-SECURITY/0100B4VR2Q5/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>satellite images</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/Article/2052919/chairman-defensive-measures-prevented-casualties-in-iranian-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>by the Pentagon</em></a><em>, and by a&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/middleeast/iran-strike-al-asad-base-iraq-exclusive-intl/index.html"><em>CNN visit to the base</em></a><em>&nbsp;days after the attack. CNN reported from the scene: “Ten of the 11 missiles struck US positions at the sprawling desert Iraqi airbase. One struck a remote location on the Iraqi military’s side.” CNN reported that “the Iranian missiles, which used on-board guidance systems, managed to shred sensitive US military sites, damaging a special forces compound, and two hangars, in addition to the US drone operators’ housing unit.”</em></p>



<p>While no US troops were killed,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/10/politics/traumatic-brain-injuries-iran-strike/index.html">more than 100</a>&nbsp;were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries. Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, told reporters that he believed Iran’s intent was to kill; he credited “the defensive techniques that our forces used” for the absence of deaths.</p>



<p>Trump has provided&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/15/no-iran-didnt-deliberately-avoid-hitting-us-base-trump-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no substantiation</a>&nbsp;for the claim that Iran called the US to telegraph the strike and offer reassurance; as the Post reported, Iraq’s prime minister said he received a general warning from Iran that it was about to begin its response and target US troops.<strong></strong></p>



<p>Trump’s claim that Israel had abandoned the assassination operation has also been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-mischaracterized-israel-role-hit-iran-soleimani-rcna120368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disputed</a>.</p>



<p><strong>What the Biden administration said about Israel and Hezbollah</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;that a top Biden national security official, or multiple officials, had foolishly said that they hoped Hezbollah did not attack Israel from the north because Israel is especially “vulnerable” there.</p>



<p>For example, Trump said in an October speech in New Hampshire:<br>“How about the person, the security person, top security person for Biden, said, ‘I hope Hezbollah doesn’t attack us from the north because that’s where we’re most vulnerable.’ Can you believe it? The following morning, we get attacked from the north. No, can you believe the guy, he’s a national security advisor. ‘I hope that Hezbollah doesn’t attack Israel from the north because that’s where we’re the most vulnerable.’ The following morning they got attacked. But this is what we’re dealing with. We’re dealing with stupid people.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump was misstating what Biden administration officials said. They did urge Hezbollah to refrain from attacking Israel from Lebanon after Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, and expressed “concern” about the possibility of a Hezbollah attack – but contrary to a central component of Trump’s stories, they did not say Israel is “most vulnerable” in the north.</em></p>



<p>Asked what Trump was referring to when he made these claims, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung pointed to October comments from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby and a senior defense official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. But neither of them said what Trump claimed.</p>



<p>Cheung pointed to this comment from Kirby at an October 11&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2023/10/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-nsc-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press briefing</a>: “And, you know, we’ve been watching with concern some of the rocket attacks that have come across the northern border of Israel from Lebanon, which obviously were coming from – from Hezbollah. So we’re – we’re clearly concerned about that.”</p>



<p>But Kirby said nothing there about the north being a particular vulnerability for Israel. Similarly, the anonymous senior defense official&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3551962/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing-on-us-force-posture-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told reporters</a>&nbsp;on October 9: “We are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict.” The official did not point to the north as a special vulnerability.</p>



<p><strong>The size of Iran’s military</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in Florida: “You know, Iran’s got close to a 3 million person army, military. That’s big stuff. You know, that’s no longer the minor leagues.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s “3 million” figure is false. “Iran’s army is about a million strong, with 1/3 of that number comprised of reservists,”&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/ali-vaez" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ali Vaez</em></a><em>, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said in an email. In 2019, the US government’s Defense Intelligence Agency used similar numbers in a&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Images/News/Military_Powers_Publications/Iran_Military_Power_LR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>report</em></a><em>&nbsp;on Iran’s military power, estimating that Iran’s military had a total of 1.06 million people, including 610,000 active personnel.</em></p>



<p><strong>Singapore and drugs</strong></p>



<p>Promoting his proposal to give the death penalty to drug dealers, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in New Hampshire, “Why wouldn’t you do it as Singapore does, the death penalty. They have no drugs whatsoever, no drugs whatsoever.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that Singapore has “no drugs whatsoever” is false. Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau said in an official report on the local&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnb.gov.sg/docs/default-source/drug-situation-report-documents/cnb-annual-statistics-2022_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>drug situation in 2022</em></a><em>: “Methamphetamine, heroin, and cannabis were the three most commonly abused drugs in 2022, with 95% of drug abusers arrested abusing at least one of these three drugs.” The report also noted that the bureau had made seizures of heroin, methamphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and various other drugs, and it said that “in Singapore, the rise of cannabis abuse is of major concern.”</em></p>



<p>In the same speech, Trump claimed that China, which also executes some drug dealers, has “no drug problem” as a result.&nbsp;<a href="https://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/faculty/Joseph-Amon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Amon</a>, director of the Office of Global Health at the Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health, said in a November email<strong>: “</strong>There is no specific definition of what is a drug ‘problem,’ but both in both China and Singapore there are people who use illicit drugs and in both countries illicit drug use is seen as a significant concern requiring government resources in terms of policing, surveillance, prevention and treatment.”</p>



<p><strong>An Iraqi judge</strong></p>



<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October speech in Florida</a>, Trump claimed that the Justice Department recently invited an Iraqi judge to visit Washington – and “after that, the foreign judge issued a warrant for my arrest for blowing up the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani. So he came in, he was invited by this incompetent president. ‘Please come in.’ And he ended up issuing an arrest for my – he wanted to arrest me because I killed the number one terrorist in the world.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate. The judge, Faiq Zidan, head of Iraq’s</em>&nbsp;<em>Supreme Judicial Council</em>, did not<em>&nbsp;issue a warrant for Trump’s arrest over the Soleimani assassination “after” he visited Washington – and, in fact,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mystery-solved-iran-backed-judge-seek-trump-arrest-visit-invite-washington-dc-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Zidan’s spokesperson told Fox News</em></a><em>&nbsp;in October that Zidan’s planned visit to Washington had been postponed. What actually happened was that in early 2023, while marking the third anniversary of the assassination, Zidan gave&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/01/iraq-judicial-chief-highlights-arrest-warrant-trump-over-soleimani-killing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>public remarks in which he discussed</em></a><em>&nbsp;how Trump was already wanted for the assassination (which took place in Iraq and also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the Iraqi deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces). An Iraqi court had&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/07/world/iraq-arrest-warrant-trump-al-muhandis-intl/index.html"><em>issued an arrest warrant for Trump in 2021</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>There is no indication that Biden himself had invited Zidan to Washington. (The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment about the matter.) Regardless, Trump’s claim that Zidan visited Washington and then issued an arrest warrant isn’t true.</p>



<p><strong>A memo about migrants</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1sC7k2qYN0w?feature=shared&amp;t=1395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition: “Just days ago, Customs and Border [Protection] – who are incredible people by the way – distributed a memo warning that Hamas, Hezbollah fighters and jihadists are infiltrating across our wide-open border.<br>They’re all over the place.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump inaccurately described this memo, which was produced by the intelligence unit at the Customs and Border Protection office in San Diego. The memo, a “situational awareness” brief for employees that was&nbsp;</em><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/22/hamas-hezbollah-southern-border/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>obtained by right-wing media outlets</em></a><em>, suggested that foreign fighters affiliated with Middle East militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah “may” try to enter the US across the Mexican border.</em><br><em>Contrary to Trump’s claim, the memo did not say these fighters “are” coming across the border or are “all over the place.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington subsequently issued an official statement to media outlets saying, “CBP has seen no indication of Hamas-directed foreign fighters seeking to make entry into the United States.”</p>



<p>The San Diego memo warned that people “inspired by, or reacting to, the current Israel-Hamas conflict may attempt travel to or from the area of hostilities in the Middle East via circuitous transit across the Southwest border.” The memo mentioned the possibility of attempted entry by “foreign fighters motivated by ideology or mercenary soldiers of fortune.”</p>



<p><strong>Migration from China</strong></p>



<p>Trump spoke in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in Florida</a>&nbsp;about young male migrants crossing the border into the US. He said, “And they’re coming from China – 16% come from China.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s “16%” figure is inaccurate.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Official data from US Customs and Border Protection</a>&nbsp;shows that Chinese nationals were involved in about 1.6% of nationwide border encounters in the 2023 fiscal year, an increase from 1% in the 2022 fiscal year but nowhere near Trump’s claim. At the southwest border in particular, Chinese nationals made up just under 1% of encounters in fiscal 2023 – a spike from fiscal 2022, when they made up less than 0.1% of encounters, but again far from what Trump said.</em></p>



<p>The federal data is not broken down by sex.</p>



<p><strong>US and European aid to Ukraine</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in Iowa that although “everybody feels badly for Ukraine,” he has a “problem with” Europe’s level of assistance to Ukraine compared to US assistance to Ukraine: “So if you look at it, Europe – so they’re at $25 billion and we’re $200 billion. Only a stupid person would make that deal.”<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s figures are grossly inaccurate. Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks aid to Ukraine,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>found</em></a><em>&nbsp;that, through July 31, the European Union was the largest contributor of aid to Ukraine since late January 2022 (including military, humanitarian and financial aid), at&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/world/ukraine-money-military-aid-intl-dg/index.html"><em>$85.1 billion in direct commitments</em></a><em>, while the US was second at $76.8 billion – and the total for Europe is even higher if you add in contributions by individual EU member states directly and through EU institutions. For example, Germany had made $23.1 billion in its own commitments, per the Kiel Institute data</em>,&nbsp;<em>in addition to providing another $19.2 billion via EU institutions.</em></p>



<p>The US was the largest contributor of military aid in particular, at $46.6 billion in commitments compared to about $18.9 billion for Germany.</p>



<h5 id="trumps-legal-cases">Trump’s legal cases</h5>



<p><strong>Trump’s New York civil case</strong></p>



<p>Criticizing the civil fraud trial against him in New York, Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in Florida that “it’s the first time they’ve ever used the statute” and that “they used the statute that’s never been used before.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EXC/63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New York Executive Law 63(12)</em></a><em>, the 1956 statute that New York Attorney General Letitia James invoked in filing the lawsuit that led to the civil trial, has been&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/nyregion/donald-trump-letitia-james-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>used for decades</em></a><em>&nbsp;by New York attorneys general against a wide range of entities, ranging from an&nbsp;</em><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-sues-juul-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>e-cigarette company</em></a><em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-sues-bus-companies-polluting-new-york-city-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>school bus companies</em></a><em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-ex-rel-james-v-exxon-mobil-corp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>oil and gas giant ExxonMobil</em></a><em>&nbsp;(which won its case).

<p>The law gives the state attorney general broad powers against people thought to be engaged in alleged “repeated fraudulent or illegal acts” or who have otherwise shown “persistent fraud or illegality.” Some experts have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-obscure-new-york-law-that-could-dismantle-trumps-empire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;that this James lawsuit against Trump over business fraud (as opposed to consumer fraud) is a novel use of the statute, but Trump’s claim was that the statute had never been used before, period.</p>



<p><strong>A lawyer at the Manhattan DA’s office</strong></p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November speech in New Hampshire</a>, Trump claimed that Biden is behind the criminal case&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/01/politics/trump-bragg-inside-indictment/index.html">brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a>. Trump also complained that Bragg’s office had hired a former senior official in the federal Justice Department, Matthew Colangelo.</p>



<p>Speaking of Biden, Trump said, “He took his top person from the Department of Justice and put him into the local New York, Manhattan DA’s office – running it. You’re not even allowed to do that. But they took the top person, as you know; I believe the name is Colangelo. They took the top person and put him into the Manhattan DA’s office.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>There is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/matthew-colangelo-manhattan-white-collar-investigations/index.html"><em>decision to join the Manhattan district attorney’s office in 2022</em></a><em>&nbsp;as&nbsp;</em><a href="https://manhattanda.org/district-attorney-bragg-announces-matthew-colangelo-as-new-senior-counsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>senior counsel to Bragg</em></a><em>. Regardless, Trump’s claim that Bragg’s hiring of Colangelo was “not even allowed” is wrong. Colangelo was free to get a new job.</em></p>



<p>Colangelo and Bragg knew each other before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney. They worked at the same time in the office of New York’s state attorney general – where Colangelo&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/matthew-colangelo-manhattan-white-collar-investigations/index.html">investigated Trump’s charity</a>&nbsp;and Trump’s financial practices and was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/nyregion/alvin-bragg-trump-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involved in bringing various lawsuits</a>&nbsp;against the Trump administration.</p>



<p>Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general in the first months of the Biden administration in early 2021 and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDIR-2022-10-26/html/CDIR-2022-10-26-DEPARTMENTS-9.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then</a>&nbsp;as principal deputy associate attorney general. As acting associate attorney general, he was third in command of the Justice Department.</p>



<p><strong>Trump’s federal gag order</strong></p>



<p>Trump criticized the gag order imposed on him by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over his federal election subversion case. Before Trump noted that the gag order was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/03/politics/chutkan-trump-gag-order-freeze/index.html">put on hold by an appeals court</a>&nbsp;in early November (pending oral arguments later in November), he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in New Hampshire: “I mean, I have a judge in Washington DC who put a gag order on me – I cannot speak. So if the fake news asked me a question about, like, something, I cannot speak. ‘I’m sorry.’ How do you think that would be in a campaign?…‘Uh what do you think about the campaign?’ ‘I’m sorry, I can’t comment.’”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claims are false. Even before the gag order was put on hold, it’s not true that the order meant Trump couldn’t comment on the election campaign or that it meant he “cannot speak” in general. The gag order was limited, tailored to restrict speech the judge believed could jeopardize the integrity of the case. It clearly permitted Trump to opine on the campaign.</em></p>



<p>The order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/politics/trump-gag-order-written-tanya-chutkan/index.html">explicitly said</a>&nbsp;that Trump was free to assert his innocence on the charges against him and to criticize the government, the Biden administration, the Justice Department, and the platforms and policies of his “current political rivals.”</p>



<p>The order specifically prohibited all “interested parties” in the case, which include Trump, from making statements (or directing others to make statements) targeting special counsel Jack Smith or his staff, court staff and supporting personnel, defense counsel or their staff, or “any reasonably foreseeable witness or the substance of their testimony.”</p>



<p><strong>The Presidential Records Act</strong></p>



<p>Trump, who has been charged with illegally retaining classified documents after his presidency,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531054-1/president-trump-addresses-supporters-west-palm-beach-florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in an October speech in Florida that, as a former president, “I come under the Presidential Records Act” and so “I can do whatever I want.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This is false. The Presidential Records Act does not say a president can do whatever they want with official documents. Rather, it says that all presidential records belong to the federal government&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2022/nr22-001#June-9-2023-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>the moment&nbsp;</em></a><em>the president leaves office. By having official records at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency, Trump was in clear contravention of the law</em>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/presidential-records.html#2202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The key sentence</a>&nbsp;from the Presidential Records Act is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”</p>



<p>Trump didn’t mention it in the October speech, but he has previously claimed that a district court decision in a civil case related to former President Bill Clinton gave Trump the right to do whatever he wants with presidential records. That’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/jun/12/why-the-bill-clinton-sock-drawer-case-is-not-compa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not true</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Trump’s New York civil trial</strong></p>



<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20231109_014900_Campaign_2024_Fmr._Pres._Trump_Campaigns_Near_Miami/start/420/end/480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;in a November speech in Florida that Biden is behind his civil fraud trial in New York: “Even that stupid trial going on in New York which has been totally discredited – everybody’s been discredited – that all comes out of the White House; that’s to discourage people from voting.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First:&nbsp;</strong><em>There is no basis for the claim that Biden or the Biden White House is behind the civil trial. The case was brought by New York state Attorney General Letitia James – after an investigation&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/letitia-tish-james-new-york-attorney-general-trump/index.html"><em>she began in 2019</em></a><em>, roughly two years before Biden became president. As Trump has repeatedly noted, James, a Democrat,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/politics/tish-letitia-james-james-trump-investigations/index.html"><em>campaigned</em></a><em>&nbsp;in 2018 on a pledge to pursue Trump. (Also, federal agencies do not have jurisdiction over state cases like this.)</em></p>



<p>James filed the lawsuit that led to this trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/trump-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-fraud-lawsuit/index.html">in September 2022</a>&nbsp;– about two months before Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html">launched his 2024 campaign</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Al Capone’s indictments</strong></p>



<p>Trump repeatedly denounced the four criminal cases against him&nbsp; as unfounded and politically motivated – and, to underscore his point, he claimed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531574-1/president-trump-speaks-florida-freedom-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-delivers-speech-in-iowa-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531752-1/president-trump-campaigns-claremont-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-campaign-event-in-derry-new-hampshire-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>&nbsp;that he has been indicted four times while the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Al-Capone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legendary gangster Al Capone</a>&nbsp;only got indicted once.</p>



<p>For example, Trump said in an October speech in Florida: “Did anybody ever hear of Al Capone? The greatest of all time, right. The greatest gangster of all time. If you look at him wrong, he’d kill you, and he’d kill you with his hands. He was a tough guy. He got indicted one time. I got indicted four times.”</p>



<p><strong>Facts First</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trump’s claim that Capone was indicted only one time is false. Capone was indicted at least six times, as&nbsp;</em><a href="https://abradschwartz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>A. Brad Schwartz</em></a><em>, the co-author of a book on Capone, told CNN</em>.</p>



<p>And that doesn’t include various criminal charges against Capone that did not involve an indictment, such as some misdemeanors, or obscure Capone cases for which CNN couldn’t immediately determine whether there was an indictment, which you can read more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/politics/fact-check-trump-al-capone-indicted-once/index.html">here</a>.</p>



<p>Capone was indicted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/law-magazines/al-capone-trial-1931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three times in 1931 alone</a>, the year he was famously convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. Schwartz, co-author of the book “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41716628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarface and the Untouchable: Al Capone, Eliot Ness, and the Battle for Chicago</a>,” explained that these three indictments were: “A secret indictment for tax evasion handed down in March 1931 (before the statute of limitations ran out for charges from the year 1924)”; a larger indictment in June 1931, with more than 20 counts, for tax evasion in the period from 1925 to 1929; “and a bootlegging conspiracy indictment, based on the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eliot-Ness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eliot Ness and his Untouchables</a>, later that same month.”</p>



<p>Before the landmark 1931 conviction, Capone was&nbsp;<a href="https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&amp;d=CC19290517.2.19&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested, indicted and convicted in 1929</a>&nbsp;for carrying concealed weapons in Philadelphia. Schwartz also noted two lesser-known indictments of Capone that did not result in a conviction: a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/chicago-tribune/19825116/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1926 federal indictment for conspiracy to violate Prohibition laws</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1933/07/28/archives/sapiro-is-indicted-in-chicago-rackets-attorney-who-sued-ford-is.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1933 county indictment for racketeering</a>.</p>



<p>Trump faces&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/trump-charges-jan-6-classified-documents/#:~:text=Former%20president%20Donald%20Trump%20faces,denied%20wrongdoing%20in%20each%20case.&amp;text=The%20most%20severe%20federal%20counts,up%20to%2020%20years%20imprisonment." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">91 total counts</a>&nbsp;over his two federal indictments and two local indictments in Georgia and New York. Schwartz said: “This isn’t a race, of course, but it may be worth noting that Capone is also way ahead in individual counts (the 1931 Prohibition indictment alone added up to five thousand conspiracy charges).”</p>



<h3 id="main-content">Trump’s false or misleading claims total 30,573 over 4 years</h3>



<h3>Washington Post</h3>



<p><strong>Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly  –  January 24, 2021</strong></p>



<h6 id="main-content">Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims as president. Nearly half came in his final year.</h6>



<p>The Fact Checker counted a total of 30,573 false or misleading claims made by President Trump during his White House tenure. Here’s what we learned. </p>



<p>He overstated the “carnage” he was inheriting, then later&nbsp;<a href="http://wapo.st/trumpclaimsdb?claim=0068">exaggerated</a>&nbsp;his “massive” crowd and&nbsp;<a href="http://wapo.st/trumpclaimsdb?claim=31575">claimed</a>, despite clear evidence to the contrary, that it had not rained during his address. He repeated the rain claim the next day, along with the&nbsp;<a href="http://wapo.st/trumpclaimsdb?claim=0012">fabricated notion</a>&nbsp;that he held the “all-time record” for appearing on the cover of Time magazine.</p>



<p>And so it went, day after day, week after week, claim after claim, from the most mundane of topics to the most pressing issues.</p>



<p>Over time, Trump unleashed his falsehoods with increasing frequency and ferocity, often by the scores in a single campaign speech or tweetstorm. What began as a relative trickle of misrepresentations, including 10 on his first day and five on the second, built into a torrent through Trump’s final days as he frenetically spread wild theories that the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5" target="_blank">coronavirus</a>&nbsp;pandemic would disappear “<a href="http://wapo.st/trumpclaimsdb?claim=17548">like a miracle</a>” and that the presidential election had been stolen — the claim that inspired Trump supporters to attack Congress on Jan. 6 and prompted his second impeachment.</p>



<p>The final tally of Trump’s presidency: 30,573 false or misleading claims — with nearly half coming in his final year.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_9">Read and search the full database of Trump’s false or misleading claims</a></p>



<p>For more than 10 years, The Fact Checker has assessed the accuracy of claims made by politicians in both parties, and that practice will continue. But Trump, with his unusually flagrant disregard for facts, posed a new challenge, as so many of his claims did not merit full-fledged fact checks. What started as a weekly feature — “What Trump got wrong on Twitter this week” — turned into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.1edb5ec9c79d&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_4&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_10">a project for Trump’s first 100 days.&nbsp;</a>Then, in response to reader requests, the Trump database was maintained for four years, despite the increasing burden of keeping it up.<img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/wpds-icons/icon-election.png" alt=""></p>



<p>The database became an untruth tracker for the ages, widely cited around the world as a measuring stick of Trump’s presidency — and as of noon Wednesday it was officially retired.</p>



<p>Whether such a tracker will be necessary for future presidents is unclear. Nonetheless, the impact of Trump’s rhetoric may reverberate for years.</p>



<p>“As a result of Trump’s constant lying through the presidential megaphone, more Americans are skeptical of genuine facts than ever before,” presidential historian Michael Beschloss said.</p>

<p>An assessment of the Fact Checker database shows the dramatic escalation in the rate of Trump’s dishonesty over time. Trump averaged about six claims a day in his first year as president, 16 claims day in his second year, 22 claims day in his third year — and 39 claims a day in his final year. Put another way, it took him 27 months to reach 10,000 claims and another 14 months to reach 20,000. He then exceeded the 30,000 mark less than five months later.</p>

<p>Trump made false claims about just about everything, big and small, so the Fact Checker database provides a window into his obsessions (and the news cycle) at the time. When he felt under siege or in trouble, he responded by trying to craft an alternative reality for his supporters — and to viciously attack his foes. Nearly half of the false claims were communicated at his campaign rallies or via his now-suspended Twitter account.</p>

<p>Claims about immigration spiked just before the 2018 midterm elections, as Trump unsuccessfully tried to keep the House of Representatives in GOP hands with exaggerated claims about “caravans” of undocumented immigrants approaching the border. Then in late 2019 he responded to the uproar over a phone call in which he urged Ukraine’s president to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden with more than 1,000 false and misleading claims on the issue in just four months.</p>



<p>False and misleading claims about the coronavirus pandemic emerged in 2020, so that by year’s end he had made more than 2,500 coronavirus-related claims — more than all of his trade claims over four years, even though trade has been one of the animating features of his presidency. Trump touted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?claim=23733&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_24">phony metrics</a>&nbsp;to claim he successfully defeated the virus, pitched ineffective “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/13/how-false-hope-spread-about-hydroxychloroquine-its-consequences/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24">cures</a>” and constantly attacked former president Barack Obama for alleged failures, such as leaving a “bare cupboard” of ventilators (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/25/trump-keeps-saying-obama-left-him-no-ventilators-number-is-16660/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24">there were almost 17,000</a>) and bungling the response to the swine flu pandemic in 2009-2010 (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/21/trumps-bizarre-effort-tag-obamas-swine-flu-response-disaster/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24">the response was considered a success</a>).</p>



<p>In October, Trump was largely quiet for six days as he recovered from his own bout with covid-19. But even so, he made nearly 4,000 false or misleading claims that month, an average of 150 a day on the days he was not ill.</p>



<p>In speech after speech, he laid the groundwork for challenging the election, making baseless claims of potential election fraud, while attacking Biden as a mental incompetent — and a “grimy, sleazy and corrupt career politician” — who could not possibly emerge as the victor.</p>



<p>“It’s going&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fraud,” Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News a month before voters went to the polls.&nbsp;“This is a terrible thing that’s happening to our&nbsp;country.”</p>



<p>After his election defeat, Trump spoke or tweeted about little except to offer lies about a stolen election, even as he or his supporters lost more than 60 court cases as judges repeatedly rejected his claims as bogus. After Nov. 3, he made more than 800 false or misleading claims about election fraud, including 76 times offering some variation of “rigged election.”</p>



<p>At his Jan. 6 speech at the Ellipse, in which he incited the attack on the Capitol, Trump made 107 false or misleading claims, almost all about the election.</p>



<p>The aftermath of what Biden and other Democrats now call the “big lie” hovers over Washington as both parties figure out whether there can be a return to a shared set of facts undergirding national debate, or whether one of the major political parties will remain captive to the sorts of conspiracy theories that marked so many of Trump’s final year of claims.</p>



<p>The events of Trump’s final weeks demonstrated the extent to which his alternate reality became woven into the fabric of the Republican Party, with the majority of GOP lawmakers voting against certifying Biden’s victory even after the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol.</p>



<p>One hallmark of Trump’s fibs was his willingness to constantly repeat the same claims, no matter how often they had been debunked. One-fifth of his nearly 2,500 claims about the economy was the same falsehood — that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/president-trumps-repeated-claim-greatest-economy-history-our-country/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36">he was responsible for creating the greatest economy in U.S. history</a>. After the coronavirus outbreak tanked the economy, he amped up the rhetoric to say he had created the greatest economy in world history. Neither claim is true; under just about every metric, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton had more robust economies during their presidencies. Even before the pandemic, Trump’s economy was already faltering because of his trade wars, with the manufacturing sector in a technical recession.</p>

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nearly 300 times Trump falsely said that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/01/president-trumps-tax-cut-not-the-biggest-in-u-s-history/?tid=lk_inline_manual_19&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_38">he&nbsp;passed the biggest tax cut in history</a>. Even before his tax cut was crafted, he promised that it would be the biggest in U.S. history — bigger than President Ronald Reagan’s in 1981. Reagan’s tax cut amounted to 2.9&nbsp;percent of the gross domestic product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 0.9&nbsp;percent of the gross domestic product, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump’s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded about 750 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times.</p>



<p>The Fact Checker also tracked Three- or Four-Pinocchio claims that Trump has said at least 20 times, earning him&nbsp;a Bottomless Pinocchio. Trump completed his term with 56 of those entries, including three — about the “rigged election,” allegations that Dominion voting machines changed votes and the falsehood that GOP poll watchers were denied access to vote-counting — that only emerged in the final months of his presidency.</p>



<p>The Bottomless Pinocchio list gives a rough approximation of the types of major falsehoods Trump said during his presidency. Roughly 25 percent exaggerated about his accomplishments, and 15 percent misled about his policies. Another 15 percent dissembled about the Russia investigation or the probe into the Ukraine phone call. Roughly 10 percent each were fibs made out of whole cloth, attacks on people he considered foes, falsehoods about the coronavirus, phony claims about the election, or false statements about Biden and his proposals.</p>



<p>As the 2020 election neared, Trump nearly 50 times falsely reassured his supporters that Mexico was footing the $15&nbsp;billion bill for his barrier along the southern border. U.S. taxpayers are paying, mostly via money Trump diverted from authorized military construction projects. This was perhaps Trump’s most famous campaign promise — during the 2016 campaign, he said more than 200 times that Mexico would pay for the wall — so he simply pretended he had fulfilled it in an effort to reassure his base that he had succeeded.</p>



<p>Many repeated claims just barely missed the cutoff for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/fact-checker-most-repeated-disinformation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_47">a Bottomless Pinocchio</a>, such as the claim that he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/09/president-trumps-shifting-claim-that-we-got-rid-johnson-amendment/?itid=lk_inline_manual_47">repealed a provision of the U.S. tax code</a>&nbsp;that prohibits religious organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. (All he did was issue a toothless executive order, but he obviously thought it was so important to evangelical groups that he falsely claimed he achieved one of their key political objectives.)</p>

One of Trump’s false claims early on as president was when he disputed that it rained during his inauguration. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Trump rarely abandons his falsehoods, so as he neared the end of his presidency his campaign rallies became longer and longer. Each speech had a familiar pattern. He would cycle through various grievances about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/04/updated-do-russia-probe-attorneys-donations-to-democrats-threaten-their-independence/?itid=lk_inline_manual_49">the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/09/trumps-very-inaccurate-claim-whistleblower-is-very-inaccurate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_49">impeachment over his Ukraine call</a>. He trashed Obama, various Democrats and of course Biden. He falsely extolled his achievements in trade, foreign policy, the economy and immigration. He offered false assurances about the pandemic and warned darkly about fraud in the upcoming election.</p>



<p>The growth of falsehoods over the course of Trump’s presidency is illustrated by one remarkable statistic.</p>



<p>The Fact Checker team recorded 492 suspect claims in Trump’s first 100 days. Just on Nov. 2, the day before the 2020 election, Trump made 503 false or misleading claims as he barnstormed across the country in a desperate effort to save his presidency.</p>



<p>The database website has a search engine that will quickly locate suspect statements made by Trump. Readers can also isolate claims by time period, subject or venue.</p>



<p>Maintaining the database over four years required detailed examination of every Trump speech, news conference, press gaggle, campaign rally and interview, as well as more than 25,000 tweets. The fact checks of Trump’s statements in the database amount to about 5&nbsp;million words.</p>



<p>The database includes any statement that might merit two or more Pinocchios under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/about-fact-checker/?itid=lk_inline_manual_56">The Fact Checker’s rating scale</a>. Trump often would repeat the same falsehood two or more times in a speech but only one instance of a claim per venue would be counted. The database did not include Facebook posts because they were often duplicative of tweets and likely staff-generated. The tally also generally did not count retweets, except for retweets of false or misleading videos.</p>



<p>The fact checks in the Trump database were written by a team that also included Salvador Rizzo, Meg Kelly and Michelle Ye Hee Lee. Graphics reporter Leslie Shapiro created the database website.</p>
